<h2 id="getting-involved"><a class="header" href="#getting-involved">Getting involved</a></h2>
<p>There is a weekly <a href="./triage.html">triage meeting</a> that takes place in our <a href="welcome.html#zulip">Zulip stream</a>. Feel free to stop by then (or any time!) to introduce yourself. </p>
<p>If you're interested in fixing bugs, though, there is no need to wait for the meeting! <a href="./triage.html#so-you-want-to-fix-a-bug">Take a look at the instructions here.</a></p>

<p>This working group is focused around implementation/design of the ‚Äúfoundations‚Äù for Async I/O. This means that we are focused on designing and implementing extensions to the language, standard library, and other &quot;core&quot; bits of support offered by the Rust organization. We do not directly work on external projects like <a href="https://tokio.rs/">tokio</a>, <a href="https://async.rs/">async-std</a>, <a href="https://github.com/smol-rs/smol/">smol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/akiles/embassy">embassy</a> and so forth, although we definitely discuss ideas and coordinate with them where appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="zulip"><a class="header" href="#zulip">Zulip</a></h2>
<p>We hold discussions on <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/187312-wg-async-foundations">the <code>#wg-async-foundations</code> stream in Zulip</a></p>

<h2 id="what-is-this"><a class="header" href="#what-is-this">What is this</a></h2>
<p>We believe Rust can become one of the most popular choices for building distributed systems, ranging from embedded devices to foundational cloud services. Whatever they're using it for, we want all developers to love using Async Rust. For that to happen, we need to move Async Rust beyond the &quot;MVP&quot; state it's in today and make it accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>This document is a collaborative effort to build a shared vision for Async Rust. <strong>Our goal is to engage the entire community in a collective act of the imagination:</strong> how can we make the end-to-end experience of using Async I/O not only a pragmatic choice, but a <em>joyful</em> one?</p>
<h2 id="where-we-are-and-where-we-are-going"><a class="header" href="#where-we-are-and-where-we-are-going">Where we are and where we are going</a></h2>
<p>The &quot;vision document&quot; starts with a <a href="./vision/characters.html">cast of characters</a>. Each character is tied to a particular Rust value (e.g., performance, productivity, etc) determined by their background; this background also informs the expectations they bring when using Rust. <a href="./vision/characters/grace.html">Grace</a>, for example, wants to keep the same level of performance she currently get with C, but with the productivity benefits of memory safety. <a href="./vision/characters/alan.html">Alan</a>, meanwhile, is hoping Rust will give him higher performance without losing the safety and ergonomics that he enjoys with garbage collected languages. </p>
<p>For each character, we write <a href="./vision/status_quo.html">&quot;status quo&quot; stories</a> that describe the challenges they face as they try to achieve their goals (and typically fail in dramatic fashion!), <strong>These stories are not fiction.</strong> They are an amalgamation of the real experiences of people using Async Rust, as reported to us by interviews, blog posts, and tweets. Writing these stories helps us gauge the cumulative impact of the various papercuts and challenges that one encounters when using Async Rust.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the vision doc, of course, is not just to tell us where we are now, but where we are going and how we will get there. For this, we include <a href="./vision/shiny_future.html">&quot;shiny future&quot; stories</a> that tell us how those same characters will fare in a few years time, when we've had a chance to improve the Async Rust experience.</p>
<h2 id="the-vision-drives-the-work"><a class="header" href="#the-vision-drives-the-work">The vision drives the work</a></h2>
<p>The vision is not just idle speculation. It is the central document that we use to organize ourselves. When we think about our <a href="./vision/roadmap.html">roadmap</a> for any given year, it is always with the aim of moving us closer to the vision we lay out here.</p>
<h2 id="involving-the-whole-community"><a class="header" href="#involving-the-whole-community">Involving the whole community</a></h2>
<p>The async vision document provides a forum where the Async Rust community can plan a great overall experience for Async Rust users. Async Rust was intentionally designed not to have a &quot;one size fits all&quot; mindset, and we don't want to change that. Our goal is to build a shared vision for the end-to-end experience while retaining the loosely coupled, exploration-oriented ecosystem we have built.</p>

<p>The process we are using to write the vision doc encourages active collaboration and &quot;positive sum&quot; thinking. It starts with a brainstorming period, during which we aim to collect as many &quot;status quo&quot; and &quot;shiny future&quot; stories as we can. </p>
<p>This brainstorming period runs for six weeks, until the end of April. For the first two weeks (until 2021-04-02), we are collecting <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/status_quo.html">&quot;status quo&quot; stories</a> only. After that, we will accept both <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/status_quo.html">&quot;status quo&quot;</a> and <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/shiny_future.html">&quot;shiny future&quot; stories</a> until the end of the brainstorming period. Finally, to cap off the brainstorming period, we will select winners for <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/awards.html">awards</a> like &quot;Most Humorous Story&quot; or &quot;Most Supportive Contributor&quot;. </p>
<p>Once the brainstorming period is complete, the working group leads will begin work on assembling the various stories and shiny futures into a coherent draft. This draft will be reviewed by the community and the Rust teams and adjusted based on feedback.</p>
<h3 id="brainstorming"><a class="header" href="#brainstorming">Brainstorming</a></h3>
<p>The brainstorming period runs until 2021-04-30:</p>
<ul>
<li>Folks open &quot;status quo&quot; and (starting 2021-04-02) &quot;shiny future&quot; story PRs against the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-async-foundations">wg-async-foundations repo</a>.
<ul>
<li><a href="vision/./how_to_vision/status_quo.html">Templates and instructions for status quo stories can be found here.</a> </li>
<li>You can also browse the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-async-foundations/labels/status-quo-story-ideas">open &quot;status quo&quot; issues</a> for ideas!</li>
<li><a href="vision/./how_to_vision/shiny_future.html">Templates and instructions for shiny future stories can be found here.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We collectively <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/comment.html">comment</a> on these PRs, helping to improve them and make them more complete.</li>
<li>Unless they contain factual inaccuracies, the aim is to merge <strong>all</strong> PRs opened in the brainstorming period.
<ul>
<li>We also expect people to sometimes extend other stories with additional details or FAQs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the end of the brainstorming period, we will vote and give <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/awards.html">awards</a> for things like &quot;most amusing&quot;. (We'd like suggestions on the best categories!)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-more-the-merrier"><a class="header" href="#the-more-the-merrier">The more the merrier!</a></h4>
<p><strong>During this brainstorming period, we want to focus on getting as many ideas as we can.</strong> Having multiple &quot;shiny futures&quot; that address the same problem is a feature, not a bug, as it will let us mix-and-match later to try and find the best overall plan. Comments and questions will be used as a <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/comment.html">tool for improving understanding or sharpening proposals.</a> Presenting alternative ideas is done by <a href="https://nikomatsakis.github.io/wg-async-foundations/vision/how_to_vision/comment.html#you-might-just-want-to-write-your-own-story">writing an alternative story</a>.</p>
<h4 id="reviewing-contributions"><a class="header" href="#reviewing-contributions">Reviewing contributions</a></h4>
<p>To merge a story or project PR, any member of the working group can open a topic on Zulip and propose it be merged. Ideally there will be no outstanding concerns. If a second member of the working group approves, the PR can then be merged.</p>
<p>Reviewers should ensure that new stories and projects are added to the <code>SUMMARY.md</code> file either before merging or directly afterwards.</p>
<h3 id="harmonizing"><a class="header" href="#harmonizing">Harmonizing</a></h3>
<p>At this point, the <a href="vision/../welcome.html#leads">wg leads</a> will write the draft vision document, drawing on the status quo and shiny future stories that were submitted.
Like an RFC, this draft vision doc will be opened for comment and improved based on the resulting feedback.
When the <a href="vision/../welcome.html#leads">wg leads</a> feel it is ready, it will be taken to the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/lang">lang</a> and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/library">libs</a> teams for approval (and other Rust teams as appropriate).</p>
<h3 id="living-document"><a class="header" href="#living-document">Living document</a></h3>
<p>This meant to be a <strong>living document</strong>. We plan to revisit it regularly to track our progress and update it based on what we've learned in the meantime. Note that the shiny future stories in particular are going to involve a fair bit of uncertainty, so we expect them to change as we go.</p>
<h2 id="wait-did-somebody-say-awards"><a class="header" href="#wait-did-somebody-say-awards">Wait, did somebody say awards?</a></h2>
<p>Yes! We are planning to give <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/awards.html">awards</a> in various categories for folks who write <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/status_quo.html">status quo</a> and <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/shiny_future.html">shiny future</a> PRs. The precise categories are TBD. Check out the <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/awards.html">awards</a> page for more details.</p>

<p>We are pretty happy to add new projects, although we would prefer only to add a new project if it has some characteristic that is distinct from the other projects we've got so far and which is important to a 'status quo' or 'shiny future' story.</p>

<p>If you have an idea you'd like to write about, please <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-async-foundations/tree/master/src/vision/status_quo/template.md">open a PR using this template</a> and adding a new file into <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-async-foundations/tree/master/src/vision/status_quo">the <code>status_quo</code> directory</a>.

<h2 id="goals-of-a-status-quo-pr"><a class="header" href="#goals-of-a-status-quo-pr">Goals of a status quo PR</a></h2>
<p>When writing a <a href="vision/how_to_vision/../status_quo.html">status quo</a> story, your goal is to present what you see as a major challenge for Async Rust. You want to draw upon people's experiences (sometimes multiple people) to show all the aspects of the problem in an engaging and entertaining way.</p>
<p>Each story is always presented from the POV of a particular <a href="vision/how_to_vision/../characters.html">character</a>. Stories should be detailed, not abstract -- it's better to give specifics than generalities. Don't say &quot;Grace visited a website to find the answer to her question&quot;, tell us whether she went to stackoverflow, asked on reddit, or found the answer on some random blog post. Ideally you should get this detail from whatever your &quot;source&quot; of the story is -- but if you are using multiple sources and they disagree, you can pick one and use the FAQ to convey some of the other alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-the-faq"><a class="header" href="#the-role-of-the-faq">The role of the FAQ</a></h2>
<p>Every status quo PR includes a FAQ. This FAQ should always include answers to some standard questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the morals of the story?
<ul>
<li>Talk about the major takeaways-- what do you see as the biggest problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are the sources for this story?
<ul>
<li>Talk about what the story is based on, ideally with links to blog posts, tweets, or other evidence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why did you choose <em>NAME</em> to tell this story?
<ul>
<li>Talk about the character you used for the story and why.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How would this story have played out differently for the other characters?
<ul>
<li>In some cases, there are problems that only occur for people from specific backgrounds, or which play out differently. This question can be used to highlight that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can feel free to add whatever other FAQs seem appropriate. You should also expect to grow the FAQ in response to questions that come up on the PR.</p>
<h2 id="the-review-process"><a class="header" href="#the-review-process">The review process</a></h2>
<p>When you open a status quo PR, people will start to <a href="vision/how_to_vision/./comment.html">comment</a> on it. These comments should always be constructive, with the goal not of negating the story but of making it more precise or more persuasive. Ideally, you should respond to every comment in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjust the story with more details or to correct factual errors.</li>
<li>Add something to the story's FAQ to explain the confusion.
<ul>
<li>If the question is already covered by a FAQ, you can just refer the commenter to that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is that, at the end of the review process, the status quo story has a lot more details that address the major questions people had.</p>

(Of course, it never hurts to have a plan too.)</p>
<p>Like <a href="vision/how_to_vision/./status_quo.html">status quo stories</a>, each shiny future story is always presented from the POV of a particular <a href="vision/how_to_vision/../characters.html">character</a>.

<li>What are the incremental steps towards realizing this shiny future?
<ul>
<li>Talk about the actual work we will do. You can link to <a href="vision/how_to_vision/../design_docs.html">design docs</a> or even add new ones, as appropriate.</li>
<li>You don't have to have the whole path figured out yet!</li>

</ul>
<p>You can feel free to add whatever other FAQs seem appropriate. You should also expect to grow the FAQ in response to questions that come up on the PR.</p>
<h2 id="the-review-process-1"><a class="header" href="#the-review-process-1">The review process</a></h2>
<p>When you opan a status quo PR, people will start to <a href="vision/how_to_vision/./comment.html">comment</a> on it. These comments should always be constructive. They usually have the form of asking &quot;in this future, what does NAME do when X happens?&quot; or asking you to elaborate on other potential problems that might arise. Ideally, you should respond to every comment in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjust the story with more details or to correct factual errors.</li>
<li>Add something to the story's FAQ to explain the confusion.
<ul>
<li>If the question is already covered by a FAQ, you can just refer the commenter to that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is that, at the end of the review process, the status quo story has a lot more details that address the major questions people had.</p>

<p>Writing a &quot;status quo&quot; or &quot;shiny future&quot; story is an act of bravery and vulnerability. In the status quo, we are asking people to talk about the things that they or others found hard, to admit that they had trouble figuring something out. In the case of the shiny future, we're asking people to put out half-baked ideas so that we can find the seeds that will grow into something amazing. It doesn't take much to make that go wrong.</p>

<p>-- <a href="https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits/habit-5/">Stephen Covey</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The golden rule is that when you leave a comment, you are looking to understand or improve the story. </p>
<p>For status quo stories, remember that these are true stories about people's experiences -- they can't be <em>wrong</em> (though they could be inaccurate). It may be that somebody tries for days to solve a problem that would've been easy if they had just known to call a particular method. That story is not wrong, it's an opportunity to write a shiny future story in which you explain how they would've learned about that method, or perhaps about how that method would become unnecessary.</p>
<p>For shiny future stories, even if you don't like the idea, you should ask comments with the goal of better understanding what the author likes about it. Understanding that may give you an idea for how to get those same benefits in a way that you are happier with. It's also valid to encourage the author to elaborate on the impact their story will have on different characters.</p>

<p>Remember, opening your own PR is free (In fact, we're giving an <a href="vision/how_to_vision/./awards.html">award</a> for being &quot;most prolific&quot;). If you find that you had a really different experience than a status quo story, or you have a different idea for a shiny future, consider just writing your own PR instead of commenting negatively on someone else's. The goal of the brainstorming phase is to put a lot of alternatives, so that we can look for opportunities to combine them and make something with the best of both. </p>

<h1 id="-design-tenets-for-async"><a class="header" href="#-design-tenets-for-async">‚úèÔ∏è Design tenets for async</a></h1>
<table><thead><tr><th>Status</th><th>Owner</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>‚ö†Ô∏è Draft ‚ö†Ô∏è</td><td>nikomatsakis</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Draft status.</strong> These tenets are a first draft. nikomatsakis plans to incorporate feedback and revise them before they are finalized.</p>
<p>The design tenets describe the key principles that drive our work on async. Hopefully, we are able to achieve and honor all of them all of the time. Sometimes, though, they come into conflict, and we have to pick -- in that case, we prefer the tenet earlier in the list.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Minimal overhead.</strong> Rust Async I/O performance should compare favourably with any other language. In the extreme case, it should be possible to use async/await without any required allocation, although this is unlikely to be a common case in production systems.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to get started, but able to do anything you want.</strong> We should make it simple to write Async I/O code and get things that work reasonably well, but it should be possible for people to obtain fine-grained control as needed.</li>
<li><strong>Async is like sync, but with blocking points clearly identified.</strong> At the highest level, writing a simple program using asynchronous I/O in Rust should be analogous to writing one that uses synchronous I/O, except that one adds <code>async</code> in front of function declarations and adds <code>.await</code> after each call. We should aim for analogous design between synchronous and asynchronous equivalents. Similarly, streams should be like asynchronous iterators. One should be able to use the same sort of combinators with streams and to iterate over them in analogous ways.</li>
<li><strong>No one true runtime.</strong> We need to be able to hook into existing runtimes in different environments, from embedded environments to runtimes like node.js. Specialized systems need specialized runtimes. </li>
<li><strong>Library ecosystem is key.</strong> We want to have a strong ecosystem of async crates, utilities, and frameworks. This will require mechanisms to write libraries/utilities/frameworks that are generic and interoperable across runtimes.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="stress-tests"><a class="header" href="#stress-tests">Stress tests</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Stress tests&quot; are important use cases that tend to &quot;stretch&quot; the design. When we are contemplating changes, it's important to look over the stress tests and make sure that they all still work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single-threaded executors:</strong> Some systems tie each task to a single thread; such tasks should be able to access data that is not <code>Send</code> or <code>Sync</code>, and the executor for those tasks should be able to be fully optimized to avoid atomic accesses, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-threaded executors:</strong> Many systems migrate tasks between threads transparently, and that should be supported as well, though tasks will be required to be <code>Send</code>.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Bring your own runtime&quot;:</strong> The Rust language itself should not require that you start threads, use epoll, or do any other particular thing.</li>
<li><strong>Zero allocation, single task:</strong> Embedded systems might want to be able to have a single task that is polled to completion and which does no allocation whatsoever.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple runtimes in one process:</strong> Sometimes people have to combine systems, each of which come with their own event loop. We should avoid assuming there is one global event loop in the system. </li>
<li><strong>Non-Rust based runtimes:</strong> Sometimes people want to integrate into event loops from other, non-Rust-based systems.</li>
<li><strong>WebAssembly in the browser:</strong> We want to integrate with WebAssembly.</li>

<p>&quot;MonsterMesh&quot; is a sensor mesh on microcontrollers using Rust. The nodes communicate wirelessly to relay their results. These sensors are built using very constrained and low power hardware without operating system, so the code is written in a <code>#[no_std]</code> environment and is very careful about available resources.</p>

<h3 id="what-makes-embedded-projects-like-monstermesh-different-from-others"><a class="header" href="#what-makes-embedded-projects-like-monstermesh-different-from-others"><strong>What makes embedded projects like MonsterMesh different from others?</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Embedded developers need to write error-free applications outside of the comfort zone of an operating system. Rust helps to prevent many classes of programming errors at compile time which inspires confidence in the software quality and and cuts time intensive build-flash-test iterations.</li>
<li>Embedded developers needs good hardware abstraction. Frameworks in other languages do not provide the sophisticated memory mapped IO to safe type abstraction tooling which have been created by the Rust teams.</li>
<li>Embedded developers care about hard real time capabilities; the concept of &quot;you only pay for what you use&quot; is very important in embedded applications. The combination of the inherently asynchronous interrupt handling of microcontrollers with the Rust async building blocks are a perfect match to effortlessly create applications with hard realtime capabilities.</li>
<li>Embedded developers are particularly appreciative of strong tooling support. The availability of the full environment via <code>rustup</code> and the integration of the full toolchain with <code>cargo</code> and <code>build.rs</code> make her very happy because she can focus on what she does best instead of having regular fights with the environment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="does-monstermesh-require-a-custom-tailored-runtime"><a class="header" href="#does-monstermesh-require-a-custom-tailored-runtime"><strong>Does MonsterMesh require a custom tailored runtime?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Yes! The tradeoffs for an embedded application like MonsterMesh and a typical server are very different. Further, most server-grade frameworks are not <code>#[no_std]</code> compatible and far exceeded the available footprint on the sensor nodes.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-of-this-project-is-likely-to-be-built-with-open-source-components-from-cratesio-1"><a class="header" href="#how-much-of-this-project-is-likely-to-be-built-with-open-source-components-from-cratesio-1"><strong>How much of this project is likely to be built with open source components from crates.io?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Having no operating system to provide abstractions to it, MonsterMesh will contain all the logic it needs to run. Much of this, especially around the hardware-software-interface is unlikely to be unique to MonsterMesh and will be sourced from crates.io. However, the further up the stack one goes, the more specialized the requirements will become.</p>

<p>TrafficMonitor is a utility written by AmoogleSoft, a public cloud provider, for monitoring network traffic as it comes into its data centers to prevent things like distributed denial-of-service attacks. It monitors <em>all</em> network traffic, looking for patterns, and deciding when to take action against certain threat vectors. TrafficMonitor runs across almost all server racks in a data center, and while it does run on top of an operating system, it is resource conscious. It's also extremely important that TrafficMonitor stay running and handle network traffic with as few &quot;hiccups&quot; as possible. TrafficMonitor is highly tuned to the needs of AmoogleSoft's cloud offering and won't run anywhere else.</p>

<ul>
<li>Networking infrastructure powers entire datacenters or even public internet infrastructure, and as such it is imperative that it run without failure.</li>
<li>It is also extremely important that such projects take few resources as possible. Being on an operating system and large server racks <em>may</em> mean that using the standard library is possible, but memory and CPU usage should be kept to a minimum.</li>
<li>This project is worked on by software developers with different backgrounds. Some are networking infrastructure experts (usually using C) while others have experience in networked applications (usually using GCed languages like Java, Go, or Node).</li>

<h3 id="does-trafficmonitor-require-a-custom-tailored-runtime"><a class="header" href="#does-trafficmonitor-require-a-custom-tailored-runtime"><strong>Does TrafficMonitor require a custom tailored runtime?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Maybe? TrafficMonitor runs on top of a full operating system and takes full advantage of that operating systems networking stack. It's possible that a runtime meant for server workloads will work with TrafficMonitor.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-of-this-project-is-likely-to-be-built-with-open-source-components-from-cratesio-3"><a class="header" href="#how-much-of-this-project-is-likely-to-be-built-with-open-source-components-from-cratesio-3"><strong>How much of this project is likely to be built with open source components from crates.io?</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>TrafficMonitor is highly specialized to the internal workings of AmoogleSoft's public cloud offering. Thus, &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; solutions will only work if they're highly flexible and highly tuneable. </li>
<li>TrafficMonitor is central to AmoogleSoft's success meaning that getting things &quot;just right&quot; is much more important than having something from crates.io that mostly works but requires little custom tuning.</li>

<ul>
<li>Reliability is the number one concern. This infrastructure is at the core of the business - it needs to work extremely reliable. A close second is being easily monitorible. If something goes wrong, AmoogleSoft needs to know very quickly what the issue is.</li>
<li>AmoggleSoft is a large company with many existing custom tooling for building, monitoring, and deploying its software. TrafficMonitor has to play nicely in a world that existed long before it came around.</li>

<ul>
<li>Many server applications are written in languages with garbage collectors. Many of the things that Rust forces users to care about are not first order concerns for those working on server applications (e.g., memory management, stack vs heap allocations, etc.). </li>
<li>Many server applications are written in languages without static type checking. The developers of YouBuy don't have much experience with statically typed languages and some of the developers early in their Rust learning journeys expressed frustration that they found it hard to get their programs to compile especially when using async constructs.</li>

<p>Alan has been adding an extension to YouBuy that launches a singleton actor which interacts with a Sqlite database using the <code>sqlx</code> crate. The Sqlite database only permits a single active connection at a time, but this is not a problem, because the actor is a singleton, and so there only should be one at a time. He consults the documentation for <code>sqlx</code> and comes up with the following code to create a connection and do the query he needs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use sqlx::Connection;

#[async_std::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), sqlx::Error&gt; {
    // Create a connection

    let conn = SqliteConnection::connect(&quot;sqlite::memory:&quot;).await?;

    // Make a simple query to return the given parameter
    let row: (i64,) = sqlx::query_as(&quot;SELECT $1&quot;)
        .bind(150_i64)

<p>Things seem to be working fairly well but sometimes when he refreshes the page he encounters a panic with the message &quot;Cannot open a new connection: connection is already open&quot;. He is flummoxed.</p>
<h2 id="searching-for-the-solution"><a class="header" href="#searching-for-the-solution">Searching for the Solution</a></h2>
<p>Alan tries to figure out what happened from the logs, but the only information he sees is that a new connection has been received. Alan turns to the documentation for the <code>sqlx</code> crate to see if there are flags that might enable extra instrumentation but he can't find any.</p>
<p>He's a bit confused, because he's accustomed to having things generally be cleaned up automatically when they get dropped (for example, dropping a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/struct.File.html"><code>File</code></a> will close it). Searching the docs, he sees the <a href="https://docs.rs/sqlx/0.5.1/sqlx/trait.Connection.html#tymethod.close"><code>close</code></a> method, but the comments confirm that he shouldn't have to call it explicitly: &quot;This method is not required for safe and consistent operation. However, it is recommended to call it instead of letting a connection drop as the database backend will be faster at cleaning up resources.&quot; Still, just in case, he decides to add a call to <code>close</code> into his code. It does seem to help some, but he is still able to reproduce the problem if he refreshes often enough. Feeling confused, he adds a log statement right before calling <code>close</code> to see if it is working:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use sqlx::Connection;

#[async_std::main]
async fn do_the_thing() -&gt; Result&lt;(), sqlx::Error&gt; {
    // Create a connection
    let conn = SqliteConnection::connect(&quot;sqlite::memory:&quot;).await?;

    // Make a simple query to return the given parameter
    let row: (i64,) = sqlx::query_as(&quot;SELECT $1&quot;)
        .bind(150_i64)
        .fetch_one(&amp;conn).await?; // &lt;----- if this await is cancelled, doesn't help

    assert_eq!(row.0, 150);
    
    // he adds this:
    log!(&quot;closing the connection&quot;);
    conn.close();

    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>
<p>He observes that in the cases where he has the problem the log statement never executes. He asks Barbara for help and she points him to <a href="https://gist.github.com/Matthias247/ffc0f189742abf6aa41a226fe07398a8">this gist</a> that explains how <code>await</code> can be canceled and it will the destructors for things that are in scope. He reads the <a href="https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/blob/0ed524d65c2a3ee2e2a6706910b85bf2bb72115f/sqlx-core/src/pool/connection.rs#L70-L74">source for the SqliteConnection destructor</a> and finds that destructor spawns a task to actually close the connection.</p>
<p>He realizes there is a race condition and the task may not have actually closed the connection before <code>do_the_thing</code> is called a second time. At this point, he is feeling pretty frustrated!</p>
<p>Next, Alan seeks verification and validation of his understanding of the source code from the <code>sqlx</code> forum. Someone on the forum explains why the destructor launches a fresh task: Rust doesn't have a way to execute async operations in a destructor.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-solution"><a class="header" href="#finding-the-solution">Finding the Solution</a></h2>
<p>Alan briefly considers rearchitecting his application in more extreme ways to retain use of async, but he gives up and seeks a more straight forward solution. He discovers <code>rusqlite</code>, a synchronous database library and adopts it. This requires some rearchitecting but solves the problem.</p>

<h2 id="the-story-1"><a class="header" href="#the-story-1">The story</a></h2>
<p><a href="vision/status_quo/../characters/alan.html">Alan</a> is used to writing web server applications using async sockets, but wants to try Rust to get that signature vroom vroom.</p>
<p>After a couple weeks learning Rust basics, Alan quickly understands <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>, and therefore has several routes built for his application that await a few things and then construct an HTTP response and send a buffered body. To build the buffered response bodies, Alan was reading a file, and then appending a signature, and putting that all into a single buffer of bytes.</p>
<p>Eventually, Alan realizes that some responses have enormous bodies, and would like to stream them instead of buffering them fully in memory. He's <em>used</em> the <code>Stream</code> trait before. Using it was very natural, and followed a similar pattern to regular <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">while let Some(chunk) = body.next().await? {
    file.write_all(&amp;chunk).await?;
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, <em>implementing</em> <code>Stream</code> turns out to be rather different. With a quick search, he learned the simple way to turn a <code>File</code> into a <code>Stream</code> with <code>ReaderStream</code>, but the signing part was much harder.</p>
<h3 id="imperatively-wrong"><a class="header" href="#imperatively-wrong">Imperatively Wrong</a></h3>
<p>Alan first hoped he could simply write signing stream imperatively, reusing his new knowledge of <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>, and assuming it'd be similar to JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">async* fn sign(file: ReaderStream) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;, Error&gt; {
    let mut sig = Signature::new();

    while let Some(chunk) = file.next().await? {
        sig.push(&amp;chunk);
        yield Ok(chunk)
    }

    yield Ok(sig.digest().await)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, that doesn't work. The compiler first complains about the <code>async* fn</code> syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-notrust">error: expected item, found keyword `async`
  --&gt; src/lib.rs:21:1
   |
21 | async* fn sign(file: ReaderStream) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;, Error&gt; {
   | ^^^^^ expected item
</code></pre>
<p>Less hopeful, Alan tries just deleting the asterisk:</p>
<pre><code class="language-notrust">error[E0658]: yield syntax is experimental
  --&gt; src/lib.rs:27:9
   |
27 |         yield Ok(chunk)
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |
   = note: see issue #43122 &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43122&gt; for more information
</code></pre>
<p>After reading about how yield is experimental, and giving up reading the 100+ comments in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43122">linked issue</a>, Alan figures he's just got to implement <code>Stream</code> manually.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-stream"><a class="header" href="#implementing-stream">Implementing <code>Stream</code></a></h3>
<p>Implementing a <code>Stream</code> means writing async code in a way that doesn't <em>feel</em> like the <code>async fn</code> that Alan has written so far. He needs to write a <code>poll</code> function and it has a lot of unfamiliar concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Pin</code></li>
<li>State machines</li>
<li><code>Wakers</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Unsure of what the final code will look like, he starts with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct SigningFile;

impl Stream for SigningFile {
    type Item = Result&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;, Error&gt;;
    
    fn poll_next(self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;, cx: &amp;mut Context)
        -&gt; Poll&lt;Self::Item&gt;
    {
 
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="pin-scream"><a class="header" href="#pin-scream">Pin :scream:</a></h3>
<p>First, he notices <code>Pin</code>. Alan wonders, &quot;Why does <code>self</code> have bounds? I've only ever seen <code>self</code>, <code>&amp;self</code>, and <code>&amp;mut self</code> before&quot;. Curious, he reads the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/struct.Pin.html"><code>std::pin</code></a> page, and a bunch of jargon about pinning data in memory. He also reads that this is useful to guarantee that an object cannot move, and he wonders why he cares about that. The only example on the page explains how to write a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/index.html#example-self-referential-struct">&quot;self-referential struct&quot;</a>, but notices it needs <code>unsafe</code> code, and that triggers an internal alarm in Alan: &quot;I thought Rust was safe...&quot;</p>
<p>After asking <a href="vision/status_quo/../characters/barbara.html">Barbara</a>, Alan realizes that the types he's depending on are <code>Unpin</code>, and so he doesn't need to worry about the unsafe stuff. It's just a more-annoying pointer type.</p>
<h3 id="state-machine"><a class="header" href="#state-machine">State Machine</a></h3>
<p>With <code>Pin</code> hopefully ignored, Alan next notices that in the imperative style he wanted originally, he didn't need to explicitly keep track of state. The state was simply the imperative order of the function. But in a <code>poll</code> function, the state isn't saved by the compiler. Alan finds blog posts about the dark ages of Futures 0.1, when it was more common for manual <code>Future</code>s to be written with a &quot;state machine&quot;.</p>
<p>He thinks about his stream's states, and settles on the following structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct SigningFile {
    state: State,
    file: ReaderStream,
    sig: Signature,
}

enum State {
    File,
    Sign,
}
</code></pre>
<p>It turns out it was more complicated than Alan thought (the author made this same mistake). The <code>digest</code> method of <code>Signature</code> is <code>async</code>, <em>and</em> it consumes the signature, so the state machine needs to be adjusted. The signature needs to be able to be moved out, and it needs to be able to store a future from an <code>async fn</code>. Trying to figure out how to represent that in the type system was difficult. He considered adding a generic <code>T: Future</code> to the <code>State</code> enum, but then wasn't sure what to set that generic to. Then, he tries just writing <code>Signing(impl Future)</code> as a state variant, but that triggers a compiler error that <code>impl Trait</code> isn't allowed outside of function return types. Patient <a href="vision/status_quo/../characters/barbara.html">Barbara</a> helped again, so that Alan learns to just store a <code>Pin&lt;Box&lt;dyn Future&gt;&gt;</code>, wondering if the <code>Pin</code> there is important.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct SigningFile {
    state: State,
}

enum State {
    File(ReaderStream, Signature),
    Signing(Pin&lt;Box&lt;dyn Future&lt;Output = Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;),
    Done,
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now he tries to write the <code>poll_next</code> method, checking readiness of individual steps (thankfully, Alan remembers <code>ready!</code> from the futures 0.1 blog posts he read) and proceeding to the next state, while grumbling away the weird <code>Pin</code> noise:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">match self.state {
    State::File(ref mut file, ref mut sig) =&gt; {
        match ready!(Pin::new(file).poll_next(cx)) {
            Some(result) =&gt; {
                let chunk = result?;
                sig.push(&amp;chunk);
                Poll::Ready(Some(Ok(chunk)))
            },
            None =&gt; {
                let sig = match std::mem::replace(&amp;mut self.state, State::Done) {
                    State::File(_, sig) =&gt; sig,
                    _ =&gt; unreachable!(),
                };
                self.state = State::Signing(Box::pin(sig.digest()));
                Poll::Pending
            }
        }
    },
    State::Signing(ref mut sig) =&gt; {
        let last_chunk = ready!(sig.as_mut().poll(cx));
        self.state = State::Done;
        Poll::Ready(Some(Ok(last_chunk)))
    }
    State::Done =&gt; Poll::Ready(None),
}
</code></pre>
<p>Oh well, at least it <em>works</em>, right?</p>
<h3 id="wakers"><a class="header" href="#wakers">Wakers</a></h3>
<p>So far, Alan hasn't paid too much attention to <code>Context</code> and <code>Poll</code>. It's been fine to simply pass them along untouched. There's a confusing bug in his state machine. Let's look more closely:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// zooming in!
match ready!(Pin::new(file).poll_next(cx)) {
    Some(result) =&gt; {
        let chunk = result?;
        sig.push(&amp;chunk);
        return Poll::Ready(Some(Ok(val));
    },
    None =&gt; {
        self.set_state_to_signing();
        // oops!
        return Poll::Pending;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In one of the branches, the state is changed, and <code>Poll::Pending</code> is returned. Alan assumes that the task will be polled again with the new state. But, since the file was done (and has returned <code>Poll::Ready</code>), there was actually no waker registered to wake the task again. So his stream just hangs forever.</p>
<p>The compiler doesn't help at all, and he re-reads his code multiple times, but because of this easy-to-misunderstand logic error, Alan eventually has to ask for help in a chat room. After a half hour of explaining all sorts of details, a kind person points out he either needs to register a waker, or perhaps use a loop.</p>
<p>All too often, since we don't want to duplicate code in multiple branches, the solution for Alan is to add an odd <code>loop</code> around the whole thing, so that the next match branch uses the <code>Context</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">loop {
    match self.state {
        State::File(ref mut file, ref mut sig) =&gt; {
            match ready!(Pin::new(file).poll_next(cx)) {
                Some(result) =&gt; {
                    let chunk = result?;
                    sig.push(&amp;chunk);
                    return Poll::Ready(Some(Ok(chunk)))
                },
                None =&gt; {
                    let sig = match std::mem::replace(&amp;mut self.state, State::Done) {
                        State::File(_, sig) =&gt; sig,
                        _ =&gt; unreachable!(),
                    };
                    self.state = State::Signing(Box::pin(sig.digest()));
                    // loop again, to catch the `State::Signing` branch
                }
            }
        },
        State::Signing(ref mut sig) =&gt; {
            let last_chunk = ready!(sig.as_mut().poll(cx));
            self.state = State::Done;
            return Poll::Ready(Some(Ok(last_chunk)))
        }
        State::Done =&gt; return Poll::Ready(None),
    }
}

<p>A little later, Alan needs to add some response body transforming to some routes, to add some app-specific framing. Upon realizing he needs to implement another <code>Stream</code> in a generic fashion, he instead closes the editor and complains on Twitter.</p>

<h2 id="the-story-2"><a class="header" href="#the-story-2">The story</a></h2>
<p>Alan heard about a project to reimplement a deprecated browser plugin using Rust and WASM. This old technology had the ability to load resources over HTTP; so it makes sense to try and implement that functionality using the Fetch API. Alan looks up the documentation of <code>web_sys</code> and realizes they need to...</p>
<ol>
<li>Call one of the <a href="https://docs.rs/web-sys/0.3.50/web_sys/struct.Window.html#method.fetch_with_request"><code>fetch</code> methods</a>, which returns a <a href="https://docs.rs/js-sys/0.3.50/js_sys/struct.Promise.html"><code>Promise</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/wasm_bindgen_futures/struct.JsFuture.html">Convert the <code>Promise</code></a> into a Rust thing called a <code>Future</code></li>
<li><code>await</code> the <code>Future</code> in an <code>async</code> function</li>
<li>Do whatever they want with the resulting data</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use web_sys::{Request, window};

fn make_request(src: &amp;url) -&gt; Request {
    // Pretend this contains all of the complicated code necessary to
    // initialize a Fetch API request from Rust
}

async fn load_image(src: String) {
    let request = make_request(&amp;url);
    window().unwrap().fetch_with_request(&amp;request).await;
    log::error!(&quot;It worked&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Alan adds calls to <code>load_image</code> where appropriate. They realize that nothing is happening, so they look through more documentation and find a thing called <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/wasm_bindgen_futures/fn.spawn_local.html"><code>spawn_local</code></a>. Once they pass the result of <code>load_image</code> into that function, they see their log message pop up in the console, and figure it's time to actually do something to that loaded image data.</p>
<p>At this point, Alan wants to put the downloaded image onto the screen, which in this project means putting it into a <code>Node</code> of the current <code>World</code>. A <code>World</code> is a bundle of global state that's passed around as things are loaded, rendered, and scripts are executed. It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">
/// All of the player's global state.
pub struct World&lt;'a&gt; {
    /// A list of all display Nodes.
    nodes: &amp;'a mut Vec&lt;Node&gt;,

    /// The last known mouse position.
    mouse_pos &amp;'a mut (u16, u16),

    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>In synchronous code, this was perfectly fine. Alan figures it'll be fine in async code, too. So Alan adds the world as a function parameter and everything else needed to parse an image and add it to our list of nodes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">async fn load_image(src: String, inside_of: usize, world: &amp;mut World&lt;'_&gt;) {
    let request = make_request(&amp;url);
    let data = window().unwrap().fetch_with_request(&amp;request).await.unwrap().etc.etc.etc;
    let image = parse_png(data, context);

    let new_node_index = world.nodes.len();
    if let Some(parent) = world.nodes.get(inside_of) {
        parent.set_child(new_node_index);
    }
    world.nodes.push(image.into());
}
</code></pre>
<p>Bang! Suddenly, the project stops compiling, giving errors like...</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">error[E0597]: `world` does not live long enough
  --&gt; src/motionscript/globals/loader.rs:21:43
</code></pre>
<p>Hmm, okay, that's kind of odd. We can pass a <code>World</code> to a regular function just fine - why do we have a problem here? Alan glances over at <code>loader.rs</code>...</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn attach_image_from_net(world: &amp;mut World&lt;'_&gt;, args: &amp;[Value]) -&gt; Result&lt;Value, Error&gt; {
    let this = args.get(0).coerce_to_object()?;
    let url = args.get(1).coerce_to_string()?;

    spawn_local(load_image(url, this.as_node().ok_or(&quot;Not a node!&quot;)?, world))
}
</code></pre>
<p>Hmm, the error is in that last line. <code>spawn_local</code> is a thing Alan had to put into everything that called <code>load_image</code>, otherwise his async code never actually did anything. But why is this a problem? Alan can borrow a <code>World</code>, or anything else for that matter, inside of async code; and it should get it's own lifetime like everything else, right?</p>
<p>Alan has a hunch that this <code>spawn_local</code> thing might be causing a problem, so Alan reads the documentation. The function signature seems particularly suspicious:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn spawn_local&lt;F&gt;(future: F) 
where
    F: Future&lt;Output = ()&gt; + 'static
</code></pre>
<p>So, <code>spawn_local</code> only works with futures that return nothing - so far, so good - and are <code>'static</code>. Uh-oh. What does that last bit mean? Alan asks Barbara, who responds that it's the lifetime of the whole program. Yeah, but... the async function is part of the program, no? Why wouldn't it have the <code>'static</code> lifetime? Does that mean all functions that borrow values aren't <code>'static</code>, or just the async ones?</p>
<p>Barbara explains that when you borrow a value in a closure, the closure doesn't gain the lifetime of that borrow. Instead, the borrow comes with it's own lifetime, separate from the closure's. The only time a closure can have a non-<code>'static</code> lifetime is if one or more of its borrows is <em>not</em> provided by it's caller, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn benchmark_sort() -&gt; usize {
    let mut num_times_called = 0;
    let test_values = vec![1,3,5,31,2,-13,10,16];

    test_values.sort_by(|a, b| {
        a.cmp(b)
        num_times_called += 1;
    });

    num_times_called
}
</code></pre>
<p>The closure passed to <code>sort_by</code> has to copy or borrow anything not passed into it. In this case, that would be the <code>num_times_called</code> variable. Since we want to modify the variable, it has to be borrowed. Hence, the closure has the lifetime of that borrow, not the whole program, because it can't be called anytime - only when <code>num_times_called</code> is a valid thing to read or write.</p>
<p>Async functions, it turns out, <em>act like closures that don't take parameters</em>! They <em>have to</em>, because all <code>Future</code>s have to implement the same trait method <code>poll</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub trait Future {
    type Output;

    fn poll(self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;, cx: &amp;mut Context&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; Poll&lt;Self::Output&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>When you call an async function, all of it's parameters are copied or borrowed into the <code>Future</code> that it returns. Since we need to borrow the <code>World</code>, the <code>Future</code> has the lifetime of <code>&amp;'a mut World</code>, not of <code>'static</code>.</p>
<p>Barbara suggests changing all of the async function's parameters to be owned types. Alan asks Grace, who architected this project. Grace recommends holding a reference to the <code>Plugin</code> that owns the <code>World</code>, and then borrowing it whenever you need the <code>World</code>. That ultimately looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">async fn load_image(src: String, inside_of: usize, player: Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;Player&gt;&gt;) {
    let request = make_request(&amp;url);
    let data = window().unwrap().fetch_with_request(&amp;request).await.unwrap().etc.etc.etc;
    let image = parse_png(data, context);

    player.lock().unwrap().update(|world| {
        let new_node_index = world.nodes.len();
        if let Some(parent) = world.nodes.get(inside_of) {
            parent.set_child(new_node_index);
        }
        world.nodes.push(image.into());
    });
}
</code></pre>
<p>It works, well enough that Alan is able to finish his changes and PR them into the project. However, Alan wonders if this could be syntactically cleaner, somehow. Right now, async and update code have to be separated - if we need to do something with a <code>World</code>, then <code>await</code> something else, that requires jumping in and out of this <code>update</code> thing. It's a good thing that we only really <em>have</em> to be async in these loaders, but it's also a shame that we practically <em>can't</em> mix <code>async</code> code and <code>World</code>s.</p>
<h2 id="-frequently-asked-questions-16"><a class="header" href="#-frequently-asked-questions-16">ü§î Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>What are the morals of the story?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Async functions capture all of their parameters for the entire duration of the function. This allows them to hold borrows of those parameters across await points.
<ul>
<li>When the parameter represents any kind of &quot;global environment&quot;, such as the <code>World</code> in this story, it may be useful for that parameter not to be captured by the future but rather supplied anew after each await point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-<code>'static</code> Futures are of limited use to developers, as lifetimes are tied to the sync stack. The execution time of most asynchronous operations does not come with an associated lifetime that an executor could use.
<ul>
<li>It is possible to use borrowed futures with <code>block_on</code> style executors, as they necessarily extend all lifetimes to the end of the Future. This is because they turn asynchronous operations back into synchronous ones.</li>
<li>Most practical executors want to release the current stack, and thus all of it's associated lifetimes. They need <code>'static</code> futures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Async programming introduces more complexity to Rust than it does, say, JavaScript. The complexity of async is <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">sometimes explained in terms of 'color'</a>, where functions of one 'color' can only call those of another under certain conditions, and developers have to keep track of what is sync and what is async. Due to Rust's borrowing rules, we actually have three 'colors', not the two of other languages with async I/O:
<ul>
<li>Sync, or 'blue' in the original metaphor. This color of function can both own and borrow it's parameters. If made into the form of a closure, it may have a lifetime if it borrows something from the current stack.</li>
<li>Owned Async, or 'red' in the original metaphor. This color of function can only own parameters, by copying them into itself at call time.</li>
<li>Borrowed Async. If an async function borrows at least one parameter, it gains a lifetime, and must fully resolve itself before the lifetime of it's parameters expires.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What are the sources for this story?</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is personal experience. Specifically, I had to do <a href="https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/blob/master/core/src/loader.rs">almost exactly this dance</a> in order to get fetch to work in Ruffle.</li>
<li>I have omitted a detail from this story: in Ruffle, we use a GC library (<code>gc_arena</code>) that imposes a special lifetime on all GC references. This is how the GC library upholds it's memory safety invariants, but it's also what forces us to pass around contexts, and once you have that, it's natural to start putting even non-GC data into it. It also means we can't hold anything from the GC in the Future as we cannot derive it's <code>Collect</code> trait on an anonymous type.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Why did you choose Alan to tell this story?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lifetimes on closures is already non-obvious to new Rust programmers and using them in the context of Futures is particularly unintuitive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How would this story have played out differently for the other characters?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Niklaus probably had a similar struggle as Alan.</li>
<li>Grace would have felt constrained by the <code>async</code> syntax preventing some kind of workaround for this problem.</li>
<li>Barbara already knew about Futures and 'static and carefully organizes their programs accordingly.</li>

<p>This is a draft &quot;status quo&quot; story submitted as part of the brainstorming period. It is derived from real-life experiences of actual Rust users and is meant to reflect some of the challenges that Async Rust programmers face today.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-1"><a class="header" href="#the-problem-1">The problem</a></h2>
<p>One day, as Alan is working on his async Rust project, he runs his application and hits an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">$ .\target\debug\application.exe
thread 'main' has overflowed its stack
</code></pre>
<p>Perplexed, Alan sees if anything with his application works by seeing if he can get output when the <code>--help</code> flag is passed, but he has no luck:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">$ .\target\debug\application.exe --help
thread 'main' has overflowed its stack
</code></pre>
<h2 id="searching-for-the-solution-1"><a class="header" href="#searching-for-the-solution-1">Searching for the solution</a></h2>
<p>Having really only ever seen stack overflow issues caused by recursive functions, Alan desperately tries to find the source of the bug but searching through the codebase for recursive functions only to find none. Having learned that Rust favors stack allocation over heap allocation (a concept Alan didn't really need to worry about before), he started manually looking through his code, searching for structs that looked &quot;too large&quot;; he wasn't able to find any candidates.</p>
<p>Confused, Alan reached out to Grace for her advice. She suggested making the stack size larger. Although she wasn't a Windows expert, she remembers hearing that stack sizes on Windows might be smaller than on Linux. After much searching, Alan discovers an option do just that: <code>RUSTFLAGS = &quot;-C link-args=-Wl,-zstack-size=&lt;size in bytes&gt;&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>While eventually Alan gets the program to run, the stack size must be set to 4GB before it does! This seems untenable, and Alan goes back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>Alan reaches out to Barbara for her expertise in Rust to see if she has something to suggest. Barbara recommends using <code>RUSTFLAGS = &quot;-Zprint-type-sizes</code> to print some type sizes and see if anything jumps out. Barbara noted that if Alan does find a type that stands out, it's usually as easy as putting some boxes in that type to provide some indirection and not have everything be stack allocated. Alan never needs the nightly toolchain, but this option requires it so he installs it using <code>rustup</code>. After searching through types, one did stand out as being quite large. Ultimately, this was a red herring, and putting parts of it in <code>Box</code>es did not help.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-solution-1"><a class="header" href="#finding-the-solution-1">Finding the solution</a></h2>
<p>After getting no where, Alan went home for the weekend defeated. On Monday, he decided to take another look. One piece of code, stuck out to him: the use of the <code>select!</code> macro from the <code>futures</code> crate. This macro allowed multiple futures to race against each other, returning the value of the first one to finish. This macro required the futures to be pinned which the docs had shown could be done by using <code>pin_mut!</code>. Alan didn't fully grasp what <code>pin_mut!</code> was actually doing when he wrote that code. The compiler had complained to him that the futures he was passing to <code>select!</code> needed to be pinned, and <code>pin_mut!</code> was what he found to make the compiler happy.</p>
<p>Looking back at the documents made it clear to Alan that this could potentially be the issue: <code>pin_mut!</code> pins futures to the stack. It was relatively clear that a possible solution would be to pin to the heap instead of the stack. Some more digging in the docs lead Alan to <code>Box::pin</code> which did just that. An extra heap allocation was of no consequence to him, so he gave it a try. Lo and behold, this fixed the issue! </p>
<p>While Alan knew enough about pinning to know how to satisfy the compiler, he didn't originally take the time to fully understand what the consequences were of using <code>pin_mut!</code> to pin his futures. Now he knows!</p>

<ul>
<li>When coming from a background of GCed languages, taking the time to understand the allocation profile of a particular piece of code is not something Alan was used to doing.</li>
<li>It was hard to tell where in his code the stack was being exhausted. Alan had to rely on manually combing his code to find the culprit.</li>

<ul>

<li>Barbara, as an expert in Rust, may have had the tools to understand that <code>pin_mut</code> is used for pinning to the stack while <code>Box::pin</code> is for pinning heap allocations.</li>

<p>Perhaps! Tokio's <code>select!</code> macro doesn't require explicit pinning of the futures it's provided, but it's unclear to this author whether it would have been smart enough to avoid pinning large futures to the stack. However, pinning is a part of the way one uses futures in Rust, so it's possible that such an issue would have arisen elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="trust-the-compiler"><a class="header" href="#trust-the-compiler">Trust the compiler</a></h3>
<p>Alan has a lot of experience in C#, but in the meantime has created some successful projects in Rust.
He has dealt with his fair share of race conditions/thread safety issues during runtime in C#, but is now starting to trust that if his Rust code compiles,
he won't have those annoying runtime problems to deal with.</p>
<p>This allows him to try to squeeze his programs for as much performance as he wants, because the compiler will stop him when he tries things that could result in runtime problems.
After seeing the performance and the lack of runtime problems, he starts to trust the compiler more and more with each project finished.</p>
<p>He knows what he can do with external libraries, he does not need to fear concurrency issues if the library cannot be used from multiple threads, because the compiler would tell him.</p>
<p>His trust in the compiler solidifies further the more he codes in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="the-first-async-project"><a class="header" href="#the-first-async-project">The first async project</a></h3>
<p>Alan now starts with his first async project. He sees that there is no async in the standard library, but after googling for &quot;rust async file open&quot;, he finds 'async_std', a crate that provides some async versions of the standard library functions.
He has some code written that asynchronously interacts with some files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use async_std::fs::File;
use async_std::prelude::*;

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let mut file = File::create(&quot;a.txt&quot;).await?;
    file.write_all(b&quot;Hello, world!&quot;).await?;
    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>
<p>But now the compiler complains that <code>await</code> is only allowed in <code>async</code> functions. He now notices that all the examples use <code>#[async_std::main]</code> 
as an attribute on the <code>main</code> function in order to be able to turn it into an <code>async main</code>, so he does the same to get his code compiling:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use async_std::fs::File;
use async_std::prelude::*;

#[async_std::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let mut file = File::create(&quot;a.txt&quot;).await?;
    file.write_all(b&quot;Hello, world!&quot;).await?;

    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>
<p>This aligns with what he knows from C#, where you also change the entry point of the program to be async, in order to use <code>await</code>.
Everything is great now, the compiler is happy, so no runtime problems, so Alan is happy.</p>
<p>The project is working like a charm.</p>
<h3 id="fractured-futures-fractured-trust"><a class="header" href="#fractured-futures-fractured-trust">Fractured futures, fractured trust</a></h3>
<p>The project Alan is building is starting to grow, and he decides to add a new feature that needs to make some API calls. He starts using <code>reqwest</code> in order to help him achieve this task.
After a lot of refactoring to make the compiler accept the program again, Alan is satisfied that his refactoring is done.
His program now boils down to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use async_std::fs::File;
use async_std::prelude::*;

#[async_std::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let mut file = File::create(&quot;a.txt&quot;).await?;
    file.write_all(b&quot;Hello, world!&quot;).await?;

    let body = reqwest::get(&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org&quot;)
        .await?
        .text()
        .await?;
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, body);

    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>
<p>He runs his project but is suddenly greeted with a runtime error. He is quite surprised. &quot;How is this even possible?&quot;, he thinks. &quot;I don't have any out-of-bounds accesses, and I never use <code>.unwrap</code> or <code>.expect</code>.&quot;
At the top of the error message he sees: <code>thread 'main' panicked at 'there is no reactor running, must be called from the context of a Tokio 1.x runtime'</code> </p>
<p>He searches what &quot;Tokio&quot; is in Rust, and he finds that it also provides an attribute to put on <code>main</code>, namely <code>[tokio::main]</code>, but what is the difference with <code>[async_std::main]</code>? His curiosity leads him to watch videos/read blogs/scour reddit,... on why there are multiple runtimes in Rust. This leads him into a rabbit hole and now he learns about Executors, Wakers, <code>Pin</code>,... He has a basic grasp of what they are, but does not have a good understanding of them or how they all fit together exactly. These are all things he had not need to know nor heed in C#. (Note: there is another story about troubles/confusion that might arise when learning all these things about async: <a href="vision/status_quo/./alan_hates_writing_a_stream.html">Alan hates writing a <code>Stream</code></a>)</p>
<p>He does understand the current problems and why there is no one-size-fits-all executor (yet). Trying to get his async Rust code to work, he broadened his knowledge about what async code actually is, he gains another way to reason about asynchronous code, not only in Rust, but also more generally.</p>
<p>But now he realizes that there is a whole new area of runtime problems that he did not have to deal with in C#, but he does in Rust.
Can he even trust the Rust compiler anymore? What other kinds of runtime problems can occur in Rust that can't in C#?
If his projects keep increasing in complexity, will other new kinds of runtime problems keep popping up? Maybe it's better to stick with C#, since Alan 
already knows all the runtime problems you can have over there.</p>
<h3 id="the-spider-man-effect"><a class="header" href="#the-spider-man-effect">The Spider-Man effect</a></h3>
<p>Do you recall in Spider-Man, that after getting bitten by the radioactive spider, Peter first gets ill before he gains his powers? Well, imagine instead of being bitten by a radioactive spider, he was bitten by an async-rust spider...</p>
<p>In his work, Alan sees an async call to a C# wrapper around SQLite, his equivalent of a spider-sense (async-sense?) starts tingling. Now knowing from Rust the complexities that arise when trying to create asynchronicity, what kind of complex mechanisms are at play here to enable these async calls from C# that end up in the C/C++ of SQLite?</p>
<p>He quickly discovers that there are no complex mechanism at all! It's actually just a synchronous call all the way down, with just some extra overhead from wrapping it into an asynchronous function. There are no points where the async function will yield. He transforms all these asynchronous calls to their synchronous counterparts, and sees a slight improvement in performance. Alan is happy, product management is happy, customers are happy!</p>
<p>Over the next few months, he often takes a few seconds to reflect about why certain parts of the code are async, if they should be, or how other parts of the code might benefit from being async and if it's possible to make them async. He also uses what he learned from async Rust in his C# code reviews to find similar problems or general issues (With great power...). He even spots some lifetime bugs w.r.t. asynchronous code in C#, imagine that.</p>
<p>His team recognizes that Alan has a pretty good grasp about what async is really about, and he is unofficially crowned the &quot;async guru&quot; of the team.</p>
<p>Even though this spider-man might have gotten &quot;ill&quot; (his negative experience with async Rust), he has now become the superhero he was meant to be!</p>

<ul>
<li>Async I/O includes a new set of runtime errors and misbehaviors that the compiler can't help you find. These include cases like executing blocking operations
in an async context but also mixing runtime libraries (something users may not even realize is a factor).</li>
<li>Rust users get used to the compiler giving them error messages for runtime problems but also helping them to fix them. Pushing error messages to runtimes
feels surprising and erodes some of their confidence in Rust.</li>
<li>The &quot;cliff&quot; in learning about async is very steep -- at first everything seems simple and similar to other languages, then suddenly you are thrown into a lot of information. It's hard to know what's important and what is not. <strong>But</strong>, at the same time, dipping your toes into async Rust can broaden the understanding a programmer has of asynchronous coding, which can help them even in other languages than Rust.</li>

<p>Alan's startup has officially launched and YouBuy is live for the world to use.
The whole team is very excited especially as this will be their first use of Rust in production! 
Normally, as a .NET shop, they would have written the entire application in C#, but because of the scalability and latency requirements on their inventory service, they decided to write a microservice in Rust utilizing the <code>async</code> features they've heard so much about.</p>
<p>The day's excitement soon turns into concern as reports begin coming into support of customers who can't checkout.
After a few cases, a pattern begins to emerge: when a customer tries to buy the last available item, the checkout process hangs forever.</p>
<p>Alan suspects there is an issue with the lock used in the inventory service to prevent multiple people from buying the last available item at the same time.
With this hunch, he builds the latest code and opens this local dev environment to conduct some tests.
Soon enough, Alan has a repro of the bug.</p>
<p>With the broken environment still running, he decides to use a debugger to see if he can confirm his theory.
In the past, Alan has used Visual Studio's debugger to <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/how-do-i-debug-async-code-in-visual-studio/#is-there-a-way-to-better-visualize-tasks-and-async-code-flow">diagnose a very similar issue in a C# application he wrote</a>.
The debugger was able to show him all the async Tasks currently waiting, their call stacks and what resource they were waiting on.</p>
<p>Alan hasn't used a debugger with Rust before, usually a combination of the strict compiler and a bit of manual testing has been enough to fix all the bugs he's previously encountered.
He does a quick Google search to see what debugger he should use and decides to go with <code>gdb</code> because it is already installed on his system and sounds like it should work.
Alan also pulls up a blog post that has a helpful cheatsheet of <code>gdb</code> commands since he's not familiar with the debugger.</p>
<p>Alan restarts the inventory service under <code>gdb</code> and gets to work reproducing the issue.
He reproduces the issue a few times in the hope of making it easier to identify the cause of the problem.
Ready to pinpoint the issue, Alan presses <code>Ctrl+C</code> and then types <code>bt</code> to get a backtrace:</p>

<p>Puzzled, the only line Alan even recognizes is the <code>main</code> entry point function for the service.
He knows that async tasks in Rust aren't run individually on their own threads which allows them to scale better and use fewer resources but surely there has to be a thread somewhere that's running his code?
Alan doesn't completely understand how async works in Rust but he's seen the <code>Future::poll</code> method so he assumes that there is a thread which constantly polls tasks to see if they are ready to wake up.
&quot;Maybe I can find that thread and inspect its state?&quot; he thinks and then consults the cheatsheet for the appropriate command to see the threads in the program.
<code>info threads</code> seems promising so he tries that:</p>
<details><summary>(gdb) info threads</summary>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">(gdb) info threads

    maxevents=1024, timeout=49152) at ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/epoll_wait.c:30
</code></pre>
</details>
<p>Alan is now even more confused: &quot;Where are my tasks?&quot; he thinks.
After looking through the cheatsheet and StackOverflow, he discovers there isn't a way to see which async tasks are waiting to be woken up in the debugger.
Taking a shot in the dark, Alan concludes that this thread must be thread which is polling his tasks since it is the only one in the program.
He googles &quot;epoll_wait rust async tasks&quot; but the results aren't very helpful and inspecting the stack frame doesn't yield him any clues as to where his tasks are so this seems to be a dead end.</p>
<p>After thinking a bit, Alan realizes that since the runtime must know what tasks are waiting to be woken up, perhaps he can have the service ask the async runtime for that list of tasks every 10 seconds and print them to stdout? 
While crude, this would probably also help him diagnose the hang.
Alan gets to work and opens the runtime docs to figure out how to get that list of tasks.
After spending 30 minutes reading the docs, looking at StackOverflow questions and even posting on users.rust-lang.org, he discovers this simply isn't possible and he will have to add tracing to his application to figure out what's going on.</p>
<p>Disgruntled, Alan begins the arduous, boring task of instrumenting the application in the hope that the logs will be able to help him.</p>

<li>Developers, especially coming from an language that has a tightly integrated development environment, expect their debugger to help them particularly in situations where &quot;println&quot; debugging can't.</li>
<li>If the debugger can't help them, developers will often try to reach for a programmatic solution such as debug functions in their runtime that can be invoked at critical code paths.</li>
<li>Trying to debug an issue by adding logging and then triggering the issue is painful because of the long turn-around times when modifying code, compiling and then repro'ing the issue.</li>

<ul>
<li>Coming from a background in managed languages where the IDE, debugger and runtime are tightly integrated, Alan would be used to using those tools to diagnose his issue.</li>

<ul>
<li>Some of the characters with either a background in Rust or a background in systems programming might know that Rust's async doesn't always map to an underlying system feature and so they might expect that <code>gdb</code> or <code>lldb</code> is unable to help them.</li>
<li>Barbara, the experienced Rust dev, might also have used a tracing/instrumentation library from the beginning and have that to fall back on rather than having to do the work to add it now.</li>

<p><a href="vision/status_quo/../projects/YouBuy.html">YouBuy</a> is written using an async web framework that predates the stabilization of async function syntax. When <a href="vision/status_quo/../characters/alan.html">Alan</a> joins the company, it is using async functions for its business logic, but can't use them for request handlers because the framework doesn't support it yet. It requires the handler's return value to be <code>Box&lt;dyn Future&lt;...&gt;&gt;</code>. Because the web framework predates async function syntax, it requires you to take ownership of the request context (<code>State</code>) and return it alongside your response in the success/error cases. This means that even with async syntax, an http route handler in this web framework looks something like this (from <a href="https://github.com/gotham-rs/gotham/blob/9f10935bf28d67339c85f16418736a4b6e1bd36e/examples/diesel/src/main.rs">the Gotham Diesel example</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// For reference, the framework defines these type aliases.
pub type HandlerResult = Result&lt;(State, Response&lt;Body&gt;), (State, HandlerError)&gt;;
pub type HandlerFuture = dyn Future&lt;Output = HandlerResult&gt; + Send;

fn get_products_handler(state: State) -&gt; Pin&lt;Box&lt;HandlerFuture&gt;&gt; {
    use crate::schema::products::dsl::*;

    async move {
        let repo = Repo::borrow_from(&amp;state);
        let result = repo.run(move |conn| products.load::&lt;Product&gt;(&amp;conn)).await;
        match result {
            Ok(prods) =&gt; {
                let body = serde_json::to_string(&amp;prods).expect(&quot;Failed to serialize prods.&quot;);
                let res = create_response(&amp;state, StatusCode::OK, mime::APPLICATION_JSON, body);
                Ok((state, res))
            }
            Err(e) =&gt; Err((state, e.into())),
        }
    }
    .boxed()
}
</code></pre>
<p>and then it is registered like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">    router_builder.get(&quot;/&quot;).to(get_products_handler);
</code></pre>
<p>The handler code is forced to drift to the right a lot, because of the async block, and the lack of ability to use <code>?</code> forces the use of a match block, which drifts even further to the right. This goes against <a href="https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md#reduce-nesting">what he has learned from his days writing go</a>.</p>
<p>Rather than switching YouBuy to a different web framework, Alan decides to contribute to the web framework himself. After a bit of a slog and a bit of where-clause-soup, he manages to make the web framework capable of using an <code>async fn</code> as an http request handler. He does this by extending the router builder with a closure that boxes up the <code>impl Future</code> from the async fn and then passes that closure on to <code>.to()</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">    fn to_async&lt;H, Fut&gt;(self, handler: H)
    where
        Self: Sized,
        H: (FnOnce(State) -&gt; Fut) + RefUnwindSafe + Copy + Send + Sync + 'static,
        Fut: Future&lt;Output = HandlerResult&gt; + Send + 'static,
    {
        self.to(move |s: State| handler(s).boxed())
    }
</code></pre>
<p>The handler registration then becomes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">    router_builder.get(&quot;/&quot;).to_async(get_products_handler);
</code></pre>
<p>This allows him to strip out the async blocks in his handlers and use <code>async fn</code> instead.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// Type the library again, in case you've forgotten:
pub type HandlerResult = Result&lt;(State, Response&lt;Body&gt;), (State, HandlerError)&gt;;

async fn get_products_handler(state: State) -&gt; HandlerResult {
    use crate::schema::products::dsl::*;

    let repo = Repo::borrow_from(&amp;state);
    let result = repo.run(move |conn| products.load::&lt;Product&gt;(&amp;conn)).await;
    match result {
        Ok(prods) =&gt; {
            let body = serde_json::to_string(&amp;prods).expect(&quot;Failed to serialize prods.&quot;);
            let res = create_response(&amp;state, StatusCode::OK, mime::APPLICATION_JSON, body);
            Ok((state, res))
        }
        Err(e) =&gt; Err((state, e.into())),
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>It's still not fantastically ergonomic though. Because the handler takes ownership of State and returns it in tuples in the result, Alan can't use the <code>?</code> operator inside his http request handlers. If he tries to use <code>?</code> in a handler, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">async fn get_products_handler(state: State) -&gt; HandlerResult {
    use crate::schema::products::dsl::*;

    let repo = Repo::borrow_from(&amp;state);
    let prods = repo
        .run(move |conn| products.load::&lt;Product&gt;(&amp;conn))
        .await?;
    let body = serde_json::to_string(&amp;prods).expect(&quot;Failed to serialize prods.&quot;);
    let res = create_response(&amp;state, StatusCode::OK, mime::APPLICATION_JSON, body);
    Ok((state, res))
}
</code></pre>
<p>then he receives:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">error[E0277]: `?` couldn't convert the error to `(gotham::state::State, HandlerError)`
  --&gt; examples/diesel/src/main.rs:84:15
   |
84 |         .await?;
   |               ^ the trait `From&lt;diesel::result::Error&gt;` is not implemented for `(gotham::state::State, HandlerError)`
   |
   = note: the question mark operation (`?`) implicitly performs a conversion on the error value using the `From` trait
   = note: required by `std::convert::From::from`
</code></pre>
<p>Alan knows that the answer is to make another wrapper function, so that the handler can take an <code>&amp;mut</code> reference to <code>State</code> for the lifetime of the future, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">async fn get_products_handler(state: &amp;mut State) -&gt; Result&lt;Response&lt;Body&gt;, HandlerError&gt; {
    use crate::schema::products::dsl::*;

    let repo = Repo::borrow_from(&amp;state);
    let prods = repo
        .run(move |conn| products.load::&lt;Product&gt;(&amp;conn))
        .await?;
    let body = serde_json::to_string(&amp;prods).expect(&quot;Failed to serialize prods.&quot;);
    let res = create_response(&amp;state, StatusCode::OK, mime::APPLICATION_JSON, body);
    Ok(res)
}
</code></pre>
<p>and then register it with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">    route.get(&quot;/&quot;).to_async_borrowing(get_products_handler);
</code></pre>
<p>but Alan can't work out how to express the type signature for the <code>.to_async_borrowing()</code> helper function. He submits his <code>.to_async()</code> pull-request upstream as-is, but it nags on his mind that he has been defeated.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, someone raises a bug about <code>?</code>, and a few other web framework contributors try to get it to work, but they also get stuck. When Alan tries it, the compiler diagnostics keep sending him around in circles <!-- TODO: examples of this. Maybe move this into the paragraph above? -->. He can work out how to express the lifetimes for a function that returns a <code>Box&lt;dyn Future + 'a&gt;</code> but not an <code>impl Future</code> because of how where clauses are expressed. Alan longs to be able to say &quot;this function takes an async function as a callback&quot; (<code>fn register_handler(handler: impl async Fn(state: &amp;mut State) -&gt; Result&lt;Response, Error&gt;)</code>) and have Rust elide the lifetimes for him, like how they are elided for async functions.</p>
<p>A month later, one of the contributors finds a forum comment by <a href="vision/status_quo/../characters/barbara.html">Barbara</a> explaining how to express what Alan is after (using higher-order lifetimes and a helper trait). They implement this and merge it. The final <code>.to_async_borrowing()</code> implementation ends up looking like this (also from <a href="https://github.com/gotham-rs/gotham/blob/89c491fb4322bbc6fbcc8405c3a33e0634f7cbba/gotham/src/router/builder/single.rs">Gotham</a>):</p>

<p>Later on, other developers on the project attempt to extend this approach to work with closures, but they encounter limitations in rustc that seem to make it not work (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70263">rust-lang/rust#70263</a>).</p>
<p>When Alan sees another open source project struggling with the same issue, he notices that Barbara has helped them out as well. Alan wonders how many people in the community would be able to write <code>.to_async_borrowing()</code> without help.</p>

<h2 id="the-story-6"><a class="header" href="#the-story-6">The story</a></h2>
<p><a href="vision/status_quo/../characters/barbara.html">Barbara</a> is contributing to an <a href="https://www.tockos.org">OS</a> that supports
running multiple applications on a single microcontroller. These
microcontrollers have as little as 10's of kilobytes of RAM and 100's of
kilobytes of flash memory for code. Barbara is writing a library that is used by
multiple applications -- and is linked into each application -- so the library
is very resource constrained. The library should support asynchronous operation,
so that multiple APIs can be used in parallel within each (single-threaded)
application.</p>
<p>Barbara begins writing the library by trying to write a console interface, which
allows byte sequences to be printed to the system console. Here is an example
sequence of events for a console print:</p>
<ol>
<li>The interface gives the kernel a callback to call when the print finishes,
and gives the kernel the buffer to print.</li>
<li>The kernel prints the buffer in the background while the app is free to do
other things.</li>
<li>The print finishes.</li>
<li>The app tells the kernel it is ready for the callback to be invoked, and the
kernel invokes the callback.</li>
</ol>
<p>Barbara tries to implement the API using
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/future/trait.Future.html"><code>core::future::Future</code></a>
so that the library can be compatible with the async Rust ecosystem. The OS
kernel does not expose a Future-based interface, so Barbara has to implement
<code>Future</code> by hand rather than using async/await syntax. She starts with a
skeleton:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">/// Passes `buffer` to the kernel, and prints it to the console. Returns a
/// future that returns `buffer` when the print is complete. The caller must
/// call kernel_ready_for_callbacks() when it is ready for the future to return. 
fn print_buffer(buffer: &amp;'static mut [u8]) -&gt; PrintFuture {
    // TODO: Set the callback
    // TODO: Tell the kernel to print `buffer`
}

struct PrintFuture;

impl core::future::Future for PrintFuture {
    type Output = &amp;'static mut [u8];

    fn poll(self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;, cx: &amp;mut Context) -&gt; Poll&lt;Self::Output&gt; {
        // TODO: Detect when the print is done, retrieve `buffer`, and return
        // it.
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note: All error handling is omitted to keep things understandable.</p>
<p>Barbara begins to implement <code>print_buffer</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn print_buffer(buffer: &amp;'static mut [u8]) -&gt; PrintFuture {
    kernel_set_print_callback(callback);
    kernel_start_print(buffer);
    PrintFuture {}
}

// New! The callback the kernel calls.
extern fn callback() {
    // TODO: Wake up the currently-waiting PrintFuture.
}
</code></pre>
<p>So far so good. Barbara then works on <code>poll</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">    fn poll(self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;, cx: &amp;mut Context) -&gt; Poll&lt;Self::Output&gt; {
        if kernel_is_print_done() {
            return Poll::Ready(kernel_get_buffer_back());
        }
        Poll::Pending
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, there's something missing here. How does the callback wake the
<code>PrintFuture</code>? She needs to store the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/task/struct.Waker.html"><code>Waker</code></a>
somewhere! Barbara puts the <code>Waker</code> in a global variable so the callback can
find it (this is fine because the app is single threaded and callbacks do NOT
interrupt execution the way Unix signals do):</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">static mut PRINT_WAKER: Option&lt;Waker&gt; = None;

extern fn callback() {
    if let Some(waker) = unsafe { PRINT_WAKER.as_ref() } {
        waker.wake_by_ref();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>She then modifies <code>poll</code> to set <code>PRINT_WAKER</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">    fn poll(self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;, cx: &amp;mut Context) -&gt; Poll&lt;Self::Output&gt; {
        if kernel_is_print_done() {
            return Poll::Ready(kernel_get_buffer_back());
        }
        unsafe { PRINT_WAKER = Some(cx.waker()); }
        Poll::Pending
    }
</code></pre>
<p><code>PRINT_WAKER</code> is stored in <code>.bss</code>, which occupies space in RAM but not flash. It
is two words in size. It points to a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/task/struct.RawWakerVTable.html"><code>RawWakerVTable</code></a>
that is provided by the executor. <code>RawWakerVTable</code>'s design is a compromise that
supports environments both with and without <code>alloc</code>. In no-<code>alloc</code> environments,
<code>drop</code> and <code>clone</code> are generally no-ops, and <code>wake</code>/<code>wake_by_ref</code> seem like
duplicates. Looking at <code>RawWakerVTable</code> makes Barbara realize that even though
<code>Future</code> was designed to work in embedded contexts, it may have too much
overhead for her use case.</p>
<p>Barbara decides to do some benchmarking. She comes up with a sample application
-- an app that blinks a led and responds to button presses -- and implements it
twice. One implementation does not use <code>Future</code> at all, the other does. Both
implementations have two asynchronous interfaces: a timer interface and a GPIO
interface, as well as an application component that uses the interfaces
concurrently. In the <code>Future</code>-based app, the application component functions
like a future combinator, as it is a <code>Future</code> that is almost always waiting for
a timer or GPIO future to finish.</p>
<p>To drive the application future, Barbara implements an executor. The executor
functions like a background thread. Because <code>alloc</code> is not available, this
executor contains a single future. The executor has a <code>spawn</code> function that
accepts a future and starts running that future (overwriting the existing future
in the executor if one is already present). Once started, the executor runs
entirely in kernel callbacks.</p>
<p>Barbara identifies several factors that add branching and error handling code to
the executor:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>spawn</code> should be a safe function, because it is called by high-level
application code. However, that means it can be called by the future it
contains. If handled naively, this would result in dropping the future while
it executes. Barbara adds runtime checks to identify this situation.</li>
<li><code>Waker</code> is <code>Sync</code>, so on a multithreaded system, a future could give another
thread access to its <code>Waker</code> and the other thread could wake it up. This
could happen while the <code>poll</code> is executing, before <code>poll</code> returns
<code>Poll::Pending</code>. Therefore, Barbara concludes that if <code>wake</code> is called while
a future is being polled then the future should be re-polled, even if the
current <code>poll</code> returns <code>Poll::Pending</code>. This requires putting a retry loop
into the executor.</li>
<li>A kernel callback may call <code>Waker::wake</code> after its future returns
<code>Poll::Ready</code>. After <code>poll</code> returns <code>Poll::Ready</code>, the executor should not
<code>poll</code> the future again, so Barbara adds code to ignore those wakeups. This
duplicates the &quot;ignore spurious wakeups&quot; functionality that exists in the
future itself.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, this made the <a href="https://github.com/tock/design-explorations/blob/master/size_comparison/futures/src/task.rs">executor
logic</a>
nontrivial, and it compiled into 96 bytes of code. The executor logic is
monomorphized for each future, which allows the compiler to make inlining
optimizations, but results in a significant amount of duplicate code.
Alternatively, it could be adapted to use function pointers or vtables to avoid
the code duplication, but then the compiler <em>definitely</em> cannot inline
<code>Future::poll</code> into the kernel callbacks.</p>
<p>Barbara publishes an
<a href="https://github.com/tock/design-explorations/tree/master/size_comparison">analysis</a>
of the relative sizes of the two app implementations, finding a large percentage
increase in both code size and RAM usage (note: stack usage was not
investigated). Most of the code size increase is from the future
combinator code.</p>
<p>In the no-<code>Future</code> version of the app, a kernel callback causes the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The kernel callback calls the application logic's event-handling function for
the specific event type.</li>
<li>The application handles the event.</li>
</ol>
<p>The call in step 1 is inlined, so the compiled kernel callback consists only of
the application's event-handling logic.</p>
<p>In the <code>Future</code>-based version of the app, a kernel callback causes the
following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The kernel callback updates some global state to indicate the event happened.</li>
<li>The kernel callback invokes <code>Waker::wake</code>.</li>
<li><code>Waker::wake</code> calls <code>poll</code> on the application future.</li>
<li>The application future has to look at the state saved in step 1 to determine
what event happened.</li>
<li>The application future handles the event.</li>
</ol>
<p>LLVM is unable to devirtualize the call in step 2, so the optimizer is unable to
simplify the above steps. Steps 1-4 only exist in the future-based version of
the code, and add over 200 bytes of code (note: Barbara believes this could be
reduced to between 100 and 200 bytes at the expense of execution speed).</p>
<p>Barbara concludes that <strong><code>Future</code> is not suitable for
highly-resource-constrained environments</strong> due to the amount of code and RAM
required to implement executors and combinators.</p>
<p>Barbara redesigns the library she is building to use a <a href="https://github.com/tock/design-explorations/tree/master/zst_pointer_async">different
concept</a>
for implementing async APIs in Rust that are much lighter weight. She has moved
on from <code>Future</code> and is refining her <a href="https://github.com/tock/libtock-rs/blob/master/core/platform/src/async_traits.rs">async
traits</a>
instead. Here are some ways in which these APIs are lighter weight than a
<code>Future</code> implementation:</p>
<ol>
<li>After monomorphization, kernel callbacks directly call application code. This
allows the application code to be inlined into the kernel callback.</li>
<li>The callback invocation is more precise: these APIs don't make spurious
wakeups, so application code does not need to handle spurious wakeups.</li>
<li>The async traits lack an equivalent of <code>Waker</code>. Instead, all callbacks are
expected to be <code>'static</code> (i.e. they modify global state) and passing pointers
around is replaced by static dispatch.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><code>core::future::Future</code> isn't suitable for every asynchronous API in Rust.
<code>Future</code> has a lot of capabilities, such as the ability to spawn
dynamically-allocated futures, that are unnecessary in embedded systems.
These capabilities have a cost, which is unavoidable without
backwards-incompatible changes to the trait.</li>
<li>We should look at embedded Rust's relationship with <code>Future</code> so we don't
fragment the embedded Rust ecosystem. Other embedded crates use <code>Future</code>
-- <code>Future</code> certainly has a lot of advantages over lighter-weight
alternatives, if you have the space to use it.</li>

<ul>
<li><code>Future</code> has many additional features that are nice-to-have:
<ol>
<li><code>Future</code> works smoothly in a multithreaded environment. Futures can
be <code>Send</code> and/or <code>Sync</code>, and do not need to have interior mutability,
which avoids the need for internal locking.
<ul>
<li>Manipulating arbitrary Rust types without locking allows <code>async fn</code>
to be efficient.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Futures can be spawned and dropped in a dynamic manner: an executor
that supports dynamic allocation can manage an arbitrary number of
futures at runtime, and futures may easily be dropped to stop their
execution.
<ul>
<li>Dropping a future will also drop futures it owns, conveniently
providing good cancellation semantics.</li>
<li>A future that creates other futures (e.g. an <code>async fn</code> that calls
other <code>async fn</code>s) can be spawned with only a single memory
allocation, whereas callback-based approaches need to allocate for
each asynchronous component.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Community and ecosystem support. This isn't a feature of <code>Future</code> per
se, but the Rust language has special support for <code>Future</code>
(<code>async</code>/<code>await</code>) and practically the entire async Rust ecosystem is
based on <code>Future</code>. The ability to use existing async crates is a very
strong reason to use <code>Future</code> over any alternative async abstraction.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>However, the code size impact of <code>Future</code> is a deal-breaker, and no number
of nice-to-have features can outweigh a deal-breaker. Barbara's traits
have every feature she <em>needs</em>.</li>
<li>Using <code>Future</code> saves developer time relative to building your own async
abstractions. Developers can use the time they saved to minimize code size
elsewhere in the project. In some cases, this may result in a net decrease
in code size for the same total effort. However, code size reduction
efforts have diminishing returns, so projects that expect to optimize code
size regardless likely won't find the tradeoff beneficial.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><code>Future</code> isolates the code that determines a future should wake up (the
code that calls <code>Waker::wake</code>) from the code that executes the future (the
executor). The only information transferred via <code>Waker::wake</code> is &quot;try
waking up now&quot; -- any other information has to be stored somewhere. When
polled, a future has to run logic to identify how it can make progress --
in many cases this requires answering &quot;who woke me up?&quot; -- and retrieve
the stored information. Most completion-driven async APIs allow
information about the event to be transferred directly to the code that
handles the event. According to Barbara's analysis, the code required to
determine what event happened was the majority of the size impact of
<code>Future</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="i-thought-future-was-a-zero-cost-abstraction"><a class="header" href="#i-thought-future-was-a-zero-cost-abstraction">I thought <code>Future</code> was a zero-cost abstraction?</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Aaron Turon <a href="https://aturon.github.io/blog/2016/08/11/futures/#zero-cost">described futures as zero-cost
abstractions</a>.
In the linked post, he elaborated on what he meant by zero-cost
abstraction, and eliminating their impact on code size was not part of
that definition. Since then, the statement that future is a zero-cost
abstraction has been repeated many times, mostly without the context that
Aaron provided. Rust has many zero-cost abstractions, most of which do not
impact code size (assuming optimization is enabled), so it is easy for
developers to see &quot;futures are zero-cost&quot; and assume that makes them
lighter-weight than they are.</li>

<li>The library Barbara is writing only works in Tock OS' userspace

that is functionally equivalent to a function call.</li>

<p>This is a draft &quot;status quo&quot; story submitted as part of the brainstorming period. It is derived from real-life experiences of actual Rust users and is meant to reflect some of the challenges that Async Rust programmers face today.</p>
<h2 id="barbaras-first-big-project-in-rust-a-journey-marred-by-doubt"><a class="header" href="#barbaras-first-big-project-in-rust-a-journey-marred-by-doubt">Barbara's first big project in Rust: a journey marred by doubt</a></h2>
<p>It's Barbara's last year at their university and for their master's thesis, they have chosen to create a distributed database.
They have chosen to use their favorite language, Rust, because Rust is a suitable language for low latency applications that they have found very pleasant to work in.
Their project presents quite a challenge since they have only written some small algorithms in Rust, and it's also their first foray into creating a big distributed system.</p>
<h3 id="deciding-to-use-async"><a class="header" href="#deciding-to-use-async">Deciding to use Async</a></h3>
<p>Up until now, Barbara has followed the development of Async from afar by reading the occasional Boats blog post, and celebrating the release announcements with the rest of the happy community.
Due to never having worked with async in other languages, and not having had a project suitable for async experimentation, their understanding of async and its ecosystem remained superficial.
However, since they have heard that async is suitable for fast networked applications, they decide to try using async for their distributed database.
After all, a fast networked application is exactly what they are trying to make.</p>
<p>To further solidify the decision of using async, Barbara goes looking for some information and opinions on async in Rust. Doubts created by reading some tweets about how most people should be using threads instead of async for simplicity reasons are quickly washed away by helpful conversations on the Rust discord.</p>
<h3 id="learning-about-async"><a class="header" href="#learning-about-async">Learning about Async</a></h3>
<p>Still enamored with the first edition of the Rust book, they decide to go looking for an updated version, hoping that it will teach them async in the same manner that it taught them so much about the language and design patterns for Rust. Disappointed, they find no mention of async in the book, aside from a note that it exists as a keyword.</p>
<p>Not to be deterred, they go looking further, and start looking for similarly great documentation about async.
After stumbling upon the async book, their disappointment is briefly replaced with relief as the async book does a good job at solidifying what they have already learned in various blog posts about async, why one would use it and even a bit about how it all works under the hood.
They skim over the parts that seem a bit too in-depth for now like pinning, as they're looking to quickly get their hands dirty.
Chapter 8: The Async Ecosystem teaches them what they already picked up on through blog posts and contentious tweets: the choice of the runtime has large implications on what libraries they can use.</p>
<h3 id="the-wrong-time-for-big-decisions"><a class="header" href="#the-wrong-time-for-big-decisions">The wrong time for big decisions</a></h3>
<p>Barbara's dreams to quickly get their hands dirty with async Rust are shattered as they discover that they first need to make a big choice: what executor to use. Having had quite a bit of exposure to the conversations surrounding the incompatible ecosystems, Barbara is perhaps a bit more paranoid about making the wrong choice than the average newcomer.
This feels like a big decision to them, as it would influence the libraries they could use and switching to a different ecosystem would be all but impossible after a while. Since they would like to choose what libraries they use before having to choose an executor, Barbara feels like the decision-making is turned on its head. </p>
<p>Their paranoia about choosing the right ecosystem is eased after a few days of research, and some more conversations on the Rust subreddit, after which they discover that most of the RPC libraries they might want to use are situated within the most popular Tokio ecosystem anyways. Tokio also has a brief tutorial, which teaches them some basic concepts within Tokio and talks a bit more about async in general.</p>
<h3 id="woes-of-a-newcomer-to-async"><a class="header" href="#woes-of-a-newcomer-to-async">Woes of a newcomer to async</a></h3>
<p>Being reasonably confident in their choice of ecosystem, Barbara starts building their distributed system.
After a while, they want to introduce another networking library of which the api isn't async. Luckily Barbara picked up on that blocking was not allowed in async (or at least not in any of the currently existing executors), through reading some blog posts about async. More reddit discussions point them towards spawn_blocking in Tokio, and even rayon. But they're none the wiser about how to apply these paradigms in a neat manner.</p>
<p>Previously the design patterns learned in other languages, combined with the patterns taught in the book, were usually sufficient to come to reasonably neat designs.
But neither their previous experience, nor the async book nor the Tokio tutorial were of much use when trying to neatly incorporate blocking code into their previously fully async project.</p>
<h3 id="confused-ever-after"><a class="header" href="#confused-ever-after">Confused ever after</a></h3>
<p>To this day the lack of a blessed approach leaves Barbara unsure about the choices they've made so far and misconceptions they might still have, evermore wondering if the original tweets they read about how most people should just stick to threads were right all along.</p>

<li>When entering Rust's async world without previous async experience, and no benchmarks for what good async design patters look like, getting started with async can be a bit overwhelming.</li>
<li>Other languages which only have a single ecosystem seem to have a much better story for beginners since there's no fear of lock in, or ecosystem fomo about making the wrong choices early on.</li>
<li>This lack of documentation on design patterns, and solid guidance about the async ecosystem for unopiniated newcomers is partially made up for by Rust's community which often provides educated opinions on the design and technical choices one should make.

<p>Like the author of this story, Barbara had previous experience with Rust. Knowing where to find the community also played a significant part in this story. This story could be construed as how Barbara got started with async while starting to maintain some async projects.</p>

<ul>
<li>Characters with previous async experience would probably have had a better experience getting started with async in Rust since they might know what design patterns to apply to async code.
On the other hand, since Rust's async story is noticeably different from other languages, having async experience in other languages might even be harmful by requiring the user to unlearn certain habits. I don't know if this is actually the case since I don't have any experience with async in other languages.</li>
<li>Characters which are less in touch with Rust's community than Barbara might have had a much worse time, since just skimming over the documentation might leave some lost, and unaware of common pitfalls. On the other hand, not having learned a lot about async through blog posts and other materials, might compel someone to read the documentation more thoroughly.</li>

<h2 id="the-story-7"><a class="header" href="#the-story-7">The story</a></h2>
<p><a href="vision/status_quo/../characters/barbara.html">Barbara</a> has been following async rust for a long time, in eager anticipation
of writing some project using async.  The last time she tried to do anything
with futures in rust was more than a year ago (before async functions), and
when you had to chain futures together with many calls to <code>then</code>
(often leading to inscrutable error messages hundreds of characters long).
This was not a pleasant experience for Barbara.</p>
<p>After watching the development of rust async/await (by following
discussions on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust">/r/rust</a> and the <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/">internals</a> forums), she wants
to start to play around with writing async code.  Before starting on any real
project, she starts with a &quot;playground&quot; where she can try to write some simple
async rust code to see how it feels and how it compares to how async code feels
in other languages she knows (like C# and JavaScript).</p>
<p>She starts by opening a blank project in VSCode with <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/">rust-analyzer</a>.  Because she's
been following the overall state of rust async, she knows that she needs a runtime,
and quickly decides to use tokio, because she knows its quite popular and well documented.</p>
<p>After looking the long length of the <a href="https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial">tokio tutorial</a>, she decides to not read
most of it right now, and tries to dive right in to writing code.  But she does
look at the &quot;<a href="https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial/hello-tokio">Hello Tokio</a>&quot; section that shows what feature flags are required by tokio:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
tokio = { version = &quot;1&quot;, features = [&quot;full&quot;] }
</code></pre>
<p>Poking around the tokio API docs in search of something to play with, she sees
a simple future that looks interesting: the <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/1.4.0/tokio/time/fn.sleep.html"><code>sleep</code></a> future
that will wait for a certain duration to elapse before resolving.</p>
<p>Borrowing again from the &quot;Hello Tokio&quot; tutorial to make sure she has the correct
spelling for the tokio macros, she writes up the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[tokio::main]
pub async fn main() {
    let mut rng = thread_rng();
    let t = Uniform::new(100, 5000);

    let mut futures = Vec::new();
    for _ in 0..10 {
        let delay = rng.sample(t);
        futures.push(tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(delay)));
    }
    println!(&quot;Created 10 futures&quot;);

    for f in futures {
        f.await;
    }

    println!(&quot;Done waiting for all futures&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This very first version she wrote compiled on the first try and had no errors
when running it.  Barbara was pleased about this.</p>
<p>However, this example is pretty boring.  The program just sits there for a few
seconds doing nothing, and giving no hints about what it's actually doing.
So for the next iteration, Barbara wants to have a message printed out
when each future is resolved.  She tries this code at first:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let mut futures = Vec::new();
for _ in 0..10 {
    let delay = rng.sample(t);
    futures.push(tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(delay)).then(|_| {
        println!(&quot;Done!&quot;);
    }));
}
println!(&quot;Created 10 futures&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>But the compiler gives this error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">error[E0277]: `()` is not a future
  --&gt; src\main.rs:13:71
   |
13 |         futures.push(tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(delay)).then(|_| {
   |                                                                       ^^^^ `()` is not a future
   |
   = help: the trait `futures::Future` is not implemented for `()`
</code></pre>
<p>Even though the error is pointing at the <code>then</code> function, Barbara pretty quickly
recognizes the problem -- her closure needs to return a future, but <code>()</code> is not
a future (though she wonders &quot;why not?&quot;).  Looking at the tokio docs is not very
helpful.  The <code>Future</code> trait isn't even defined in the tokio docs, so
she looks at the docs for the Future trait in the rust standard library docs
and she sees it only has 5 implementors; one of them is called <code>Ready</code>
which looks interesting.
Indeed, this struct is a future that will resolve instantly, which is what
she wants:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">for _ in 0..10 {
    let delay = rng.sample(t);
    futures.push(tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(delay)).then(|_| {
        println!(&quot;Done!&quot;);
        std::future::ready(())
    }));
}
</code></pre>
<p>This compiles without error, but when Barbara goes to run the code, the output
surprises her a little bit:  After waiting running the program, nothing happened
for about 4 seconds.  Then the first &quot;Done!&quot; message was printed, followed very
quickly by the other 9 messages.   Based on the code she wrote, she expected 10
&quot;Done!&quot; messages to be printed to the console over the span of about 5 seconds,
with roughly a uniform distribution.</p>
<p>After running the program few more times, she always observes that while the
first view messages are printed after some delay, the last few messages are
always printed all at once.</p>
<p>Barbara has experience writing async code in JavaScript, and so she thinks for
a moment about how this toy code might have looked like if she was using JS:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript ignore">async function main() {
    const futures = [];
    for (let idx = 0; idx &lt; 10; idx++) {
        const delay = 100 + (Math.random() * 4900);
        const f = new Promise(() =&gt; {
            setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(&quot;Done!&quot;), delay)
        })
        futures.push(f);
    }

    Promise.all(futures);
}
</code></pre>
<p>After imagining this code, Barbara has an &quot;ah-ha!&quot; moment, and realizes the
problem is likely how she is waiting for the futures in her rust code.
In her rust code, she is waiting for the futures one-by-one, but in the
JavaScript code she is waiting for all of them simultaneously.</p>
<p>So Barbara looks for a way to wait for a Vec of futures.  After a bunch of
searching in the tokio docs, she finds nothing.  The closet thing she finds
is a <code>join!</code> macro, but this appears to only work on individually specified
futures, not a Vec of futures.</p>
<p>Disappointed, she then looks at the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/future/index.html">future module</a> from the rust standard
library, but module is tiny and very
clearly doesn't have what she wants.  Then Barbara has another &quot;ah-ha!&quot; moment
and remembers that there's a 3rd-party crate called &quot;<a href="https://crates.io/crates/futures">futures</a>&quot;
on crates.io that she's seen mentioned in some /r/rust posts.  She checks the
docs and finds the <code>join_all</code> function which looks like what she wants:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let mut futures = Vec::new();
for _ in 0..10 {
    let delay = rng.sample(t);
    futures.push(tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(delay)).then(|_| {
        println!(&quot;Done!&quot;);
        std::future::ready(())
    }));
}
println!(&quot;Created 10 futures&quot;);

futures::future::join_all(futures).await;
println!(&quot;Done&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>It works exactly as expected now!  After having written the code, Barbara begins
to remember an important detail about rust futures that she once read somewhere:
rust futures are lazy, and won't make progress unless you await them.</p>
<p>Happy with this success, Barbara continues to expand her toy program by making
a few small adjustments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">for counter in 0..10 {
    let delay = rng.sample(t);
    let delay_future = tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(delay));

    if counter &lt; 9 {
        futures.push(delay_future.then(|_| {
            println!(&quot;Done!&quot;);
            std::future::ready(())
        }));
    } else {
        futures.push(delay_future.then(|_| {
            println!(&quot;Done with the last future!&quot;);
            std::future::ready(())
        }));
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This fails to compile:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">error[E0308]: mismatched types

   = note: expected closure `[closure@src\main.rs:16:44: 19:14]`
              found closure `[closure@src\main.rs:21:44: 24:14]`
   = note: no two closures, even if identical, have the same type
   = help: consider boxing your closure and/or using it as a trait object
</code></pre>
<p>This error doesn't actually surprise Barbara that much, as she is familiar with
the idea of having to box objects sometimes.  She does
notice the &quot;consider boxing your closure&quot; error, but thinks that this is not
likely the correct solution.  Instead, she thinks that she should box the
entire future.</p>
<p>She first adds explicit type annotations to the Vec:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let mut futures: Vec&lt;Box&lt;dyn Future&lt;Output=()&gt;&gt;&gt; = Vec::new();
</code></pre>
<p>She then notices that her IDE (VSCode + rust-analyzer) has a new error on
each call to push.  The code assist on each error says <code>Store this in the heap by calling 'Box::new'</code>.  She is exactly what she wants, and it happy that
rust-analyzer perfectly handled this case.</p>
<p>Now each future is boxed up, but there is one final error still,
this time on the call to <code>join_all(futures).await</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">error[E0277]: `dyn futures::Future&lt;Output = ()&gt;` cannot be unpinned
  --&gt; src\main.rs:34:31
   |
34 |     futures::future::join_all(futures).await;
</code></pre>
<p>Barbara has been around rust for long enough to know that there is a <code>Box::pin</code>
API, but she doesn't really understand what it does, nor does she have a good
intuition about what this API is for.  But she is accustomed to just trying
things in rust to see if they work.  And indeed, after changing <code>Box::new</code> to
<code>Box::pin</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">futures.push(Box::pin(delay_future.then(|_| {
    println!(&quot;Done!&quot;);
    std::future::ready(())
})));
</code></pre>
<p>and adjusting the type of the Vec:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let mut futures: Vec&lt;Pin&lt;Box&lt;dyn Future&lt;Output=()&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; = Vec::new();
</code></pre>
<p>the code compiles and runs successfully.</p>
<p>But even though the run is working correctly, she wishes she had a better idea
why pinning is necessary here and feels a little uneasy having to use something
she doesn't yet understand well.</p>
<p>As one final task, Barbara wants to try to replace the chained call to <code>then</code>
with a async block.  She remembers that these were a big deal in a recent
release of rust, and that they looked a lot nicer than a long chain of <code>then</code>
calls.  She doesn't remember the exact syntax for this, but she read a blog
post about async rust a few weeks ago, and has a vague idea of how it looks.</p>
<p>She tries writing this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">futures.push(Box::pin(async || {
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(delay)).await;
    println!(&quot;Done after {}ms&quot;, delay);
}));
</code></pre>
<p>The compiler gives an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">error[E0658]: async closures are unstable
  --&gt; src\main.rs:14:31
   |
14 |         futures.push(Box::pin(async || {
   |                               ^^^^^
   |
   = note: see issue #62290 &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/62290&gt; for more information
   = help: add `#![feature(async_closure)]` to the crate attributes to enable
   = help: to use an async block, remove the `||`: `async {`
</code></pre>
<p>Barbara knows that async is stable and using this nightly feature isn't what
she wants.  So the tries the suggestion made by the compiler and removes the <code>||</code> bars:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">futures.push(Box::pin(async {
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(delay)).await;
    println!(&quot;Done after {}ms&quot;, delay);
}));
</code></pre>
<p>A new error this time:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">error[E0597]: `delay` does not live long enough
15 | |             tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(delay)).await;
   | |                                                      ^^^^^ borrowed value does not live long enough
</code></pre>
<p>This is an error that Barbara is very familiar with.  If she was working with
a closure, she knows she can use a move-closure (since her <code>delay</code> type is <code>Copy</code>).
But she not using a closure (she just tried, but the compiler told her to switch
to an async block), but Barbara's experience with rust tells her that it's a very
consistent language.  Maybe the same keyword used in move closures will work here?
She tries it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">futures.push(Box::pin(async move {
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(delay)).await;
    println!(&quot;Done after {}ms&quot;, delay);
}));
</code></pre>
<p>It works!  Satisfied but still thinking about async rust, Barbara takes a break
to eat a cookie.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Due to Barbara's long experience with rust, she knows most of the language
pretty well (except for things like async, and advanced concepts like pinned objects).
She generally <a href="vision/status_quo/./alan_started_trusting_the_rust_compiler_but_then_async.html">trusts the rust compiler</a>, and she's learned over the years that she
can learn how to use an unfamiliar library by reading the API docs.  As long
as she can get the types to line up and the code to compile, things generally
work as she expects.</p>
<p>But this is not the case with rust async:</p>
<ul>
<li>There can be new syntax to learn (e.g. async blocks)</li>
<li>It can be hard to find basic functionality (like <code>futures::future::join_all</code>)</li>
<li>It's not always clear how the ecosystem all fits together
(what functionality is part of tokio?  What is part of the
standard library?  What is part of other crates like the
<code>futures</code> crate?)</li>
<li>Sometimes it looks like there multiple ways to do something:
<ul>
<li>What's the difference between <code>futures::future::Future</code> and <code>std::future::Future</code>?</li>
<li>What's the difference between <code>tokio::time::Instant</code> and <code>std::time::Instant</code>?</li>
<li>What's the difference between <code>std::future::ready</code> and <code> futures::future::ok</code>?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barbara's has a lot to learn.  Her usual methods of learning how to use
new crates doesn't really work when learning tokio and async.  She wonders
if she actually should have read the long tokio tutorial before starting.
She realizes it will take her a while to build up the necessary foundation
of knowledge before she can be proficient in async rust.</p>

<p>This is a draft &quot;status quo&quot; story submitted as part of the brainstorming period. It is derived from real-life experiences of actual Rust users and is meant to reflect some of the challenges that Async Rust programmers face today. </p>
<h2 id="the-story-8"><a class="header" href="#the-story-8">The story</a></h2>
<p>Barbara has years of experience in Rust and was looking forward to using some of that experience with the brand-new async functionality. Async/await had been a dream of Rust for so long, and it was finally here!</p>
<p>As she began her next side project, she would quickly partner up with other experienced Rust developers. One of these Rust developers, who had more async experience than Barbara, suggested they use 'async streams' as the core abstraction for this project. Barbara trusted the experience of this other developer. Though she didn't yet understand how async streams worked, she was happy to go along with the decision and build her experience over time.</p>
<p>Month after month, the side project grew in scope and number of users. Potential contributors would try to contribute, but some would leave because they found the combination of concepts and the additional set of borrowchecker-friendly code patterns difficult to understand and master. Barbara was frustrated to lose potential contributors but kept going.</p>
<p>Users also began to discover performance bottlenecks as they pushed the system harder. Barbara, determined to help the users as best she could, pulled her thinking cap tight and started to probe the codebase.</p>
<p>In her investigations, she experimented with adding parallelism to the async stream. She knew that if she called <code>.next()</code> twice, that in theory she should have two separate futures. There were a few ways to run multiple futures in parallel, so this seemed like it might pan out to be a useful way of leveraging the existing architecture.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to Barbara's chagrin, async streams do not support this kind of activity. Each <code>.next()</code> must be awaited so that the ownership system allowed her to get the next value in the stream. Effectively, this collapsed the model to being a synchronous iterator with a more modern scent. Barbara was frustrated and started to clarify her understanding of what asynchrony actually meant, looking through the implementations for these abstractions.</p>
<p>When she was satisfied, she took a step back and thought for a moment. If optional parallelism was a potential win and the core data processing system actually was going to run synchronously anyway -- despite using async/await extensively in the project -- perhaps it would make more sense to redesign the core abstraction.</p>
<p>With that, Barbara set off to experiment with a new engine for her project. The new engine focused on standard iterators and rayon instead of async streams. As a result, the code was much easier for new users, as iterators are well-understood and have good error messages. Just as importantly, the code was noticeably faster than its async counterpart. Barbara benchmarked a variety of cases to be sure, and always found that the new, simpler approach performed better than the async stream original.</p>
<p>To help those who followed after her, Barbara sat down to write out her experiences to share with the rest of the world. Perhaps future engineers might learn from the twists and turns her project took.</p>

<ul>
<li>Easy to get the wrong idea. The current state of documentation does not make the use cases clear, so it's easy to grab this as an abstraction because it's the closest that fits.</li>
<li>Async streams are just iterators. Async streams do not offer useful asynchrony in and of themselves. A possible help here might be renaming &quot;async streams&quot; to &quot;async iterators&quot; to help underscore their use case and help developers more quickly understand their limitations.</li>
<li>A single async stream can not be operated on in parallel. They open up asynchrony only during the <code>.next()</code> step and are unable to offer asynchrony between steps (eg by calling <code>.next()</code> twice and operating on the resulting Futures).</li>

<li>We tried a number of different approaches including <a href="https://crates.io/crates/async_stream">using the <code>async_stream!</code></a> macro, <a href="https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/1916">removing off the <code>async_stream!</code> macro</a> because of the error message cliff, and variations of the above.</li>

<p>Barbara is an experienced engineer who may come to async streams and async/await in general with a partially-incorrect set of baseline understanding. It may take her time to understand and see more clearly where her model was wrong because there are things similar to other experiences she's had. For example, Rust futures differ from C++ futures and do not offer the same style of asynchrony. Terms like &quot;streams&quot; sound like they may have more internal functionality, and it would be easy for an experienced developer to trip up with the wrong starting assumption.</p>

<ul>
<li>Alan may have come to a similar idea for an architecture, as async/await is popular in languages like JavaScript and C#. Once Alan attempted to use asynchrony between units of work, namely using async streams, this is where Alan may have failed. The amount of Rust one has to know to succeed here is quite high and includes understanding Arc, Pin, Streams, traits/adapters, the borrowchecker and dealing with different types of errors, and more.</li>
<li>Grace may have chosen a different core abstraction from the start. She has a good chance of thinking through how she'd like the data processing system to work. It's possible she would have found threads and channels a better fit. This would have had different trade-offs.</li>
<li>Niklaus may have also tried to go down the async stream path. The information available is mixed and hype around async/await is too strong. This makes it shine brighter than it should. Without experience with different systems languages to temper the direction, the most likely path would be to experiment with asynchrony and hope that &quot;underneath the surface it does the right thing.&quot;</li>

<p>Barbara is triaging the reported bugs for her SLOW library. For each bug, she tries to quickly see if she can diagnose the basic area of code that is affected so she knows which people to ping to help fix it. She opens a bug report from a user complaining about a panic when too many connections arrive at the same time. The bug report includes a backtrace from the user's code, and it looks like this:</p>

<p>Barbara finds the text overwhelming. She can't just browse it to figure out what code is affected. Instead, she pops up a new tab with gist.github.com copies the text into that handy text box and starts deleting stuff. To start, she deletes the first few lines until her code appears, then she deletes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the extra lines from calls to <code>poll</code> that are introduced by the async fn machinery;</li>
<li>the bits of code that come from tokio that don't affect her;</li>
<li>the intermediate wrappers from the standard library pertaining to thread-local variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>She's a bit confused by the <code>::{closure}</code> lines on her symbols but she learned by now that this is normal for <code>async fn</code>. After some work, she has reduced her stack to this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">thread 'main' panicked at 'something bad happened here', src/main.rs:16:5
stack backtrace:
   1: slow_rs::process_one::{{closure}} at ./src/main.rs:16:5

  19: slow_rs::main
note: Some details are omitted, run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` for a verbose backtrace.
</code></pre>
<p>Based on this, she is able to figure out who to ping about the problem. She pastes her reduced stack trace into the issue pings Alan, who is responsible that module. Alan thanks her for reducing the stack trace and mentions, &quot;Oh, when I used to work in C#, this is what the stack traces always looked like. I miss those days.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Here are some standard FAQ to get you started. Feel free to add more!</em></p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-morals-of-the-story-11"><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-morals-of-the-story-11"><strong>What are the morals of the story?</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust stack traces -- but async stack traces in particular -- reveal lots of implementation details to the user:
<ul>
<li>Bits of the runtime and intermediate libraries whose source code is likely not of interest to the user (but it might be);</li>
<li>Intermediate frames from the stdlib;</li>
<li><code>::{closure}</code> symbols on async functions and blocks (even though they don't appear to be closures to the user);</li>
<li>calls to <code>poll</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-the-sources-for-this-story-9"><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-sources-for-this-story-9"><strong>What are the sources for this story?</strong></a></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-async-foundations/issues/69#issuecomment-803208049">Sergey Galich</a> reported this problem, among many others.</p>

<p>She knows about the desugarings that give rise to symbols like <code>::{closure}</code>, but she still finds them annoying to deal with in practice.</p>
<h3 id="how-would-this-story-have-played-out-differently-for-the-other-characters-10"><a class="header" href="#how-would-this-story-have-played-out-differently-for-the-other-characters-10"><strong>How would this story have played out differently for the other characters?</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Other characters might have wasted a lot of time trying to read through the stack trace in place before editing it.</li>
<li>They might not have known how to trim down the stack trace to something that focused on their code, or it might have taken them much longer to do so.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-does-this-compare-to-other-languages"><a class="header" href="#how-does-this-compare-to-other-languages"><strong>How does this compare to other languages?</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust's async model does have some advantages, because the complete stack trace is available unless there is an intermediate <code>spawn</code>.</li>
<li>Other languages have developed special tools to connect async functions to their callers, however, which gives them a nice experience. For example, Chrome has a <a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/async-call-stack/#toc-enable">UI for enabling stacktraces that cross await points</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Because it came in an issue report (or, freqently, as a crash report or email).</li>

<h2 id="the-story-10"><a class="header" href="#the-story-10">The story</a></h2>
<p><a href="vision/status_quo/../characters/barbara.html">Barbara</a> has an initial prototype of a new service she wrote in sync Rust. She then decides, since the service is extremely I/O bound, to port it to async Rust and her benchmarks have led her to believe that performance is being left on the table.</p>
<p>She does this by sprinkling <code>async/.await</code> everywhere, picking an executor, and moving dependencies from sync to async.</p>
<p>Once she has the program compiling, she thinks &quot;oh that was easy&quot;. She runs it for the first time and surprisingly she finds out that when hitting an endpoint, nothing happens.</p>
<p>Barbara, always prepared, has already added logging to her service and she checks the logs. As she expected, she sees here that the endpoint handler has been invoked but then... nothing. Barbara exclaims, &quot;Oh no! This was not what I was expecting, but let's dig deeper.&quot; </p>
<p>She checks the code and sees that the endpoint spawns several tasks, but unfortunately those tasks don't have much logging in them.</p>
<p>Barbara knows that debugging with a traditional debugger is not very fruitful in async Rust. She does a deep dive into the source code and doesn't find anything. Then she adds much more logging, but to her dismay she finds that a particular task seems stuck, but she has no idea why.</p>
<p>She really wishes that there was a way to get more insight into why the task is stuck. These were the thoughts inside her head at that moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it waiting on I/O?</li>
<li>Is there a deadlock?</li>
<li>Did she miss some sync code that might still be there and messing with the executor?</li>
</ul>
<p>For the I/O question she knows to use some tools on her operating system (lsof). This reveals some open sockets but she's not sure how to act on this.</p>
<p>She scans the code for any std lib imports that might be blocking, but doesn't find anything.</p>
<p>After hours of crawling through the code, she notices that her task is receiving a message from a bounded async channel. She changes this to be an unbounded channel and then things start working.</p>
<p>She wants to know why the code was not working, but unfortunately she has no way to gain insight into this issue. She fears that her task might use too much memory knowing that the channel is unbounded, but she can't really tell.</p>
<p>She thinks, &quot;Anyhow it is working now, let's see if we got some performance gains.&quot; After thorough benchmarking she finds out that she didn't quite get the performance gain she was expecting. &quot;Something is not working, as intended&quot;, she thinks.</p>

<h2 id="the-story-11"><a class="header" href="#the-story-11">The story</a></h2>
<p>When examining her service metrics, <a href="vision/status_quo/../characters/grace.html">Grace</a> notices tail latencies in the P99 that exceed their target. She identifies GC in the routing layer as the culprit. Grace follows industry trends and is already aware of Rust and its ecosystem at a high level. She decides to investigate rewriting the routing service in Rust.</p>
<p>To meet throughput requirements, Grace has already decided to use a thread-per-core model and minimize cross-thread communication. She explores available ecosystem options and finds no option that gets her exactly what she is looking for out of the box. However, she can use Tokio with minimal configuration to achieve her architecture.</p>
<p>A few months of frantic hacking follow.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ule4vhcY1xEKQ/giphy.gif" alt="montage of cats typing" width=200></img></p>
<p>Soon enough, she and her team have a proof of concept working. They run some local stress tests and notice that 5% of requests hang and fail to respond. The client eventually times out. She cannot reproduce this problem when running one-off requests locally. It only shows up when sending above 200 requests-per-second. </p>
<p>She realizes that she doesn't have any tooling to give her insight into what's going on. She starts to add lots of logging, attempting to tie log entries to specific connections. Using an operating system tool, she can identify the socket addresses for the hung connections, so she also includes the socket addresses in each log message. She then filters the logs to find entries associated with hung connections. Of course, the logs only tell her what the connection managed to do successfully; they don't tell her why it stopped -- so she keeps going back to add more logging until she can narrow down the exact call that hangs.</p>
<p>Eventually, she identifies that the last log message is right before authenticating the request. An existing C library performs authentication, integrated with the routing service using a custom future implementation. She eventually finds a bug in the implementation that resulted in occasional lost wake-ups.</p>
<p>She fixes the bug. The service is now working as expected and meeting Grace's performance goals.</p>

<h2 id="the-story-12"><a class="header" href="#the-story-12">The story</a></h2>
<p>When Grace searched crates.io for a library, she found an interesting library that she wants to use. The code examples use a map/reduce style. As Grace is more familiar with C and C++, as a first step she wants to convert them from this style to using loops.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">Controller::new(root_kind_api, ListParams::default())
    .owns(child_kind_api, ListParams::default())
    .run(reconcile, error_policy, context)
    .for_each(|res| async move {
        match res {
            Ok(o) =&gt; info!(&quot;reconciled {:?}&quot;, o),
            Err(e) =&gt; warn!(&quot;reconcile failed: {}&quot;, Report::from(e)),
        }
    })
    .await;
</code></pre>
<p>(Example code from taken from https://github.com/clux/kube-rs)</p>
<p>So she takes the naive approach to just convert that as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">let controller = Controller::new(root_kind_api, ListParams::default())
    .owns(child_kind_api, ListParams::default())
    .run(reconcile, error_policy, context);

while let Ok(o) = controller.try_next().await {
    info!(&quot;reconciled {:?}&quot;, o),
}
</code></pre>
<p>when she compiles her source code she ends up with wall of error messages like the following:</p>

<h2 id="-warning-draft-status--16"><a class="header" href="#-warning-draft-status--16">üöß Warning: Draft status üöß</a></h2>
<p>This is a draft &quot;status quo&quot; story submitted as part of the brainstorming period. It is derived from real-life
experiences of actual Rust users and is meant to reflect some of the challenges that Async Rust programmers face today.</p>
<h2 id="the-story-13"><a class="header" href="#the-story-13">The story</a></h2>
<p><a href="vision/status_quo/../characters/grace.html">Grace</a> is integrating a camera into an embedded project. Grace has done similar projects before in the past, and has
even used this particular hardware before. Fortunately, the camera manufacturer provides a library in C to interface
with the driver.</p>
<p>Grace knows that Rust provides strong memory safety guarantees, and the library provided by the manufacturer sports an
API that is easy to misuse. In particular, ownership concerns are tricky and Grace and her team have often complained in
the past that making memory mistakes is very easy and one has to be extremely careful to manage lifetimes. Therefore,
for this project, Grace opts to start with Rust as many of the pitfalls of the manufacturer's library can be
automatically caught by embedding the lifetimes into a lightweight wrapper over code bridged into Rust with <a href="vision/status_quo///docs.rs/bindgen/">bindgen</a>.</p>
<p>Grace's team manages to write a thin Rust wrapper over the manufacturer's library with little complication. This library
fortunately offers two interfaces for grabbing frames from the camera: a blocking interface that waits for the next
frame, and a non-blocking interface that polls to check if there are any frames currently available and waiting. Grace
is tempted to write a callback-based architecture by relying on the blocking interface that waits; however, early the
next morning the customer comes back and informs her that they are scaling up the system, and that there will now be 5
cameras instead of 1.</p>
<p>She knows from experience that she cannot rely on having 5 threads blocking just for getting camera frames, because the
embedded system she is deploying to only has 2 cores total! Her team would be introducing a lot of overhead into the
system with the continuous context switching of every thread. Some folks were unsure of Rust's asynchronous
capabilities, and with the requirements changing there were some that argued maybe they should stick to the tried and
true in pure C. However, Grace eventually convinced them that the benefits of memory safety were still applicable, and
that a lot of bugs that have taken weeks to diagnose in the past have already been completely wiped out. The team
decided to stick with Rust, and dig deeper into implementing this project in async Rust.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Grace notices the similarities between the polling interface in the underlying C library and the <code>Poll</code>
type returned by Rust's <code>Future</code> trait. &quot;Surely,&quot; she thinks, &quot;I can asynchronously interleave polls to each camera over
a single thread, and process frames as they become available!&quot; Such a thing would be quite difficult in C while
guaranteeing memory safety was maintained. However, Grace's team has already dodged that bullet thanks to writing a thin
wrapper in Rust that manages these tricky lifetimes!</p>
<h3 id="the-first-problem-polls-and-wake-ups"><a class="header" href="#the-first-problem-polls-and-wake-ups">The first problem: polls and wake-ups</a></h3>
<p>Grace sets out to start writing the pipeline to get frames from the cameras. She realizes that while the polling call
that the manufacturer provided in their library is similar in nature to a future, it doesn't quite encompass everything.
In C, one might have to set some kind of heartbeat timer for polling. Grace explains to her team that this heartbeat is
similar to how the <code>Waker</code> object works in a <code>Future</code>'s <code>Context</code> type, in that it is how often the execution
environment should re-try the future if the call to <code>poll</code> returns <code>Poll::Pending</code>.</p>
<p>A member of Grace's team asks her how she was able to understand all this. After all, Grace had been writing Rust about
as long as the rest of her team. The main difference was that she had many more years of systems programming under C and
C++ under her belt than they had. Grace responded that for the most part she had just read the documentation for the
<code>Future</code> trait, and that she had intuited how async-await de-sugars itself into a regular function that returns a future
of some kind. The de-sugaring process was, after all, very similar to how lambda objects in C++ were de-sugared as well.
She leaves her teammate with <a href="vision/status_quo///smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/10/26/async-fn-in-traits-are-hard/">an
article</a> she once found online that
explained the process in a lot more detail for a problem much harder than they were trying to solve.</p>
<p>Something Grace and her team learn to love immediately about Rust is that writing the <code>Future</code> here does not require her
team to write their own execution environment. In fact, the future can be entirely written independently of the
execution environment. She quickly writes an async method to represent the polling process:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">/// Gets the next frame from the camera, waiting `retry_after` time until polling again if it fails.
///
/// Returns Some(frame) if a frame is found, or None if the camera is disconnected or goes down before a frame is
/// available.
async fn next_frame(camera: &amp;Camera, retry_after: Duration) -&gt; Option&lt;Frame&gt; {
    while camera.is_available() {
        if let Some(frame) = camera.poll() {
            return Some(frame);
        } else {
            task::sleep_for(retry_after).await;
        }
    }

    None
}
</code></pre>
<p>The underlying C API doesn't provide any hooks that can be used to wake the <code>Waker</code> object on this future up, so Grace
and her team decide that it is probably best if they just choose a sufficiently balanced <code>retry_after</code> period in which
to try again. It does feel somewhat unsatisfying, as calling <code>sleep_for</code> feels about as hacky as calling
<code>std::this_thread::sleep_for</code> in C++. However, there is no way to directly interoperate with the waker without having a
separate thread of execution wake it up, and the underlying C library doesn't have any interface offering a notification
for when that should be. In the end, this is the same kind of code that they would write in C, just without having to
implement a custom execution loop themselves, so the team decides it is not a total loss.</p>
<h3 id="the-second-problem-doing-this-many-times"><a class="header" href="#the-second-problem-doing-this-many-times">The second problem: doing this many times</a></h3>
<p>Doing this a single time is fine, but an end goal of the project is to be able to stream frames from the camera for
unspecified lengths of time. Grace spends some time searching, and realizes that what she actually wants is a <code>Stream</code>
of some kind. <code>Stream</code> objects are the asynchronous equivalent of iterators, and her team wants to eventually write
something akin to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let frame_stream = stream_from_camera(camera, Duration::from_millis(5));

while let Some(frame) = frame_stream.next().await {
    // process frames
}

println!(&quot;Frame stream closed.&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>She scours existing crates, in particular looking for one way to transform the above future into a stream that can be
executed many times. The only available option to transform a future into a series of futures is <a href="vision/status_quo///docs.rs/futures/0.1.17/futures/stream/fn.unfold.html"><code>stream::unfold</code></a>,
which seems to do exactly what Grace is looking for. Grace begins by adding a small intermediate type, and then plugging
in the remaining holes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct StreamState {
    camera: Camera,
    retry_after: Duration,
}

fn stream_from_camera(camera: Camera, retry_after: Duration) -&gt; Unfold&lt;Frame, ??, ??&gt; {
    let initial_state = StreamState { camera, retry_after };

    stream::unfold(initial_state, |state| async move {
        let frame = next_frame(&amp;state.camera, state.retry_after).await
        (frame, state)
    })
}
</code></pre>
<p>This looks like it mostly hits the mark, but Grace is left with a couple of questions for how to get the remainder of
this building:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the type that fills in the third template parameter in the return? It should be the type of the future that
is returned by the async closure passed into <code>stream::unfold</code>, but we don't know the type of a closure!</li>
<li>What is the type that fills in the second template parameter of the closure in the return?</li>
</ol>
<p>Grace spends a lot of time trying to figure out how she might find those types! She asks <a href="vision/status_quo/../characters/barbara.html">Barbara</a> what the idiomatic
way to get around this in Rust would be. Barbara explains again how closures don't have concrete types, and that the
only way to do this will be to use the <code>impl</code> keyword.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn stream_from_camera(camera: Camera, retry_after: Duration) -&gt; impl Stream&lt;Item = Frame&gt; {
    // same as before
}
</code></pre>
<p>While Grace was was on the correct path and now her team is able to write the code they want to, she realizes that
sometimes writing the types out explicitly can be very hard. She reflects on what it would have taken to write the type
of an equivalent function pointer in C, and slightly laments that Rust cannot express such as clearly.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-morals-of-the-story-15"><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-morals-of-the-story-15"><strong>What are the morals of the story?</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust was the correct choice for the team across the board thanks to its memory safety and ownership. The
underlying C library was just too complex for any single programmer to be able to maintain in their head all at
once while also trying to accomplish other tasks.</li>
<li>Evolving requirements meant that the team would have had to either start over in plain C, giving up a lot of the
safety they would gain from switching to Rust, or exploring async code in a more rigorous way.</li>
<li>The async code is actually much simpler than writing the entire execution loop in C themselves. However, the
assumption that you would write the entire execution loop is baked into the underlying library which Grace's team
cannot rewrite entirely from scratch. Integrating Rust async code with other languages which might have different
mental models can sometimes lead to unidiomatic or unsatisfying code, even if the intent of the code in Rust is
clear.</li>
<li>Grace eventually discovered that the problem was best modeled as a stream, rather than as a single future.
However, converting a future into a stream was not necessarily something that was obvious for someone with a C/C++
background.</li>
<li>Closures and related types can be very hard to write in Rust, and if you are used to being very explicit with your
types, tricks such as the <code>impl</code> trick above for <code>Stream</code>s aren't immediately obvious at first glance.</li>

<ul>
<li>I am a C++ programmer who has written many event / callback based systems for streaming from custom camera
hardware. I mirror Grace in that I am used to using other systems languages, and even rely on libraries in those
languages as I've moved to Rust. I did not want to give up the memory and lifetime benefits of Rust because of
evolving runtime requirements.</li>
<li>In particular, C and C++ do not encourage async-style code, and often involve threads heavily. However, some
contexts cannot make effective use of threads. In such cases, C and C++ programmers are often oriented towards
writing custom execution loops and writing a lot of logic to do so. Grace discovered the benefit of not having to
choose an executor upfront, because the async primitives let her express most of the logic without relying on a
particular executor's behaviour.</li>

<p>If you would like to expand on this story, or adjust the answers to the FAQ, feel free to open a PR making edits (but keep in mind that, as they reflect peoples' experiences, status quo stories <a href="vision/status_quo/../how_to_vision/comment.html#comment-to-understand-or-improve-not-to-negate-or-dissuade">cannot be wrong</a>, only inaccurate).

<h2 id="the-story-14"><a class="header" href="#the-story-14">The story</a></h2>
<p>Niklaus, who sometimes goes by the pen name &quot;Starol Klichols&quot;, has authored some long-form documentation about Rust that people have found helpful. One could even go so far as to call this documentation a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/">&quot;book&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>Niklaus has typically minimized the use of crates in documentation like this as much as possible. Niklaus has limited time to dedicate to keeping the documentation up to date, and given the speed at which the ecosystem sometimes evolves, it's hard to keep up when crates are involved. Also, Niklaus would like to avoid limiting the readership of the documentation to the users of a particular crate only, and would like to avoid any accusations of favoritism.</p>
<p>But Niklaus would really really like to document async to avoid disappointing <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-async-foundations/blame/5ce418ac4076850f515034010cc51b707441f695/src/vision/status_quo/barbara_makes_their_first_steps_into_async.md#L22">people like Barbara</a>!</p>
<p>Niklaus was excited about <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/65875">the RFC proposing that <code>block_on</code> be added to the stdlib</a>, because it seemed like that would solve Niklaus' problems. Niklaus would really like to include <code>async</code> in a big update to the documentation. No pressure.</p>

<p>If you're interested in fixing bugs, there is no need to wait for the triage meeting.
Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AE-mentor+label%3AA-async-await+no%3Aassignee">mentored async-await bugs that have no assignee</a>.
Every mentored bug should have a few comments.
If you see one you like, you can add the <code>@rustbot claim</code> comment into the bug and start working on it!
Feel to reach out to the mentor on <a href="./welcome.html#zulip">Zulip</a> to ask questions.</p>
<h2 id="project-board"><a class="header" href="#project-board">Project board</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/projects/2">project board</a> tracks various bugs and other work items for the async foundation group.
It is used to drive the triage process.</p>
<h2 id="triage-process"><a class="header" href="#triage-process">Triage process</a></h2>
<p>In our weekly triage meetings, we take new issues assigned <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/A-async-await"><code>A-async-await</code></a> and categorize them. 
The process is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/projects/2">project board</a>, from right to left:
<ul>
<li>Look at what got <strong>Done</strong>, and celebrate! :tada:</li>
<li>Review <strong>In progress</strong> issues to check we are making progress and there is a clear path to finishing (otherwise, move to the appropriate column)</li>
<li>Review <strong>Blocked</strong> issues to see if there is anything we can do to unblock</li>
<li>Review <strong>Claimed</strong> issues to see if they are in progress, and if the assigned person still intends to work on it</li>
<li>Review <strong>To do</strong> issues and assign to anyone who wants to work on something</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Review <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Arust-lang+is%3Aissue+label%3AA-async-await+is%3Aopen+-label%3AAsyncAwait-Triaged&amp;type=Issues">uncategorized issues</a>
<ul>
<li>Mark <code>P-low</code>, <code>P-medium</code>, or <code>P-high</code></li>
<li>Add <code>P-high</code> and <em>assigned</em> <code>E-needs-mentor</code> issues to the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/projects/2">project board</a></li>
<li>Mark <code>AsyncAwait-triaged</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there's still a shortage of <strong>To do</strong> issues, review the list of <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Arust-lang+is%3Aissue+label%3AAsyncAwait-Triaged+label%3AP-medium+is%3Aopen&amp;type=Issues"><code>P-medium</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Arust-lang+is%3Aissue+label%3AAsyncAwait-Triaged+label%3AP-low+is%3Aopen&amp;type=Issues"><code>P-low</code></a> issues for candidates</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mentoring"><a class="header" href="#mentoring">Mentoring</a></h2>
<p>If an issue is a good candidate for mentoring, mark <code>E-needs-mentor</code> and try to find a mentor.</p>
<p>Mentors assigned to issues should write up mentoring instructions. 
<strong>Often, this is just a couple lines pointing to the relevant code.</strong> 
Mentorship doesn't require intimate knowledge of the compiler, just some familiarity and a willingness to look around for the right code.</p>
<p>After writing instructions, mentors should un-assign themselves, add <code>E-mentor</code>, and remove <code>E-needs-mentor</code>. 
On the project board, if a mentor is assigned to an issue, it should go to the <strong>Claimed</strong> column until mentoring instructions are provided. 
After that, it should go to <strong>To do</strong> until someone has volunteered to work on it.</p>
<h1 id="-design-documents"><a class="header" href="#-design-documents">üî¨ Design documents</a></h1>
<p>The <strong>design documents</strong> (or &quot;design docs&quot;, more commonly) describe potential designs. These docs vary greatly in terms of their readiness to be implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early on, they describe a vague idea for a future. Often this takes the shape of capturing constraints on the solution, rather than the solution itself.</li>
<li>When a feature is getting ready to ship, they can evolve into a full blown RFC, with links to tracking issues or other notes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="early-stage-design-docs"><a class="header" href="#early-stage-design-docs">Early stage design docs</a></h2>
<p>In the early stages, design docs are meant to capture interesting bits of &quot;async design space&quot;. They are often updated to capture the results of a fruitful conversation or thread which uncovered contraints or challenges in solving a particular problem. They will capture a combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>use cases;</li>
<li>interesting aspects to the design;</li>
<li>alternatives;</li>
<li>interactions with other features.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="late-stage-design-docs"><a class="header" href="#late-stage-design-docs">Late stage design docs</a></h2>
<p>As a design progresses, the doc should get more and more complete, until it becomes something akin to an RFC. (Often, at that point, we will expand the design document into a directory, adding an actual RFC draft and other contents; those things can live in this repo or elsewhere, depending.) Once we decide to put a design doc onto the roadmap, it will also contain links to tracking issues or other places to track the status.</p>
<h1 id="-yield-safe-lint"><a class="header" href="#-yield-safe-lint">‚ö†Ô∏è Yield-safe lint</a></h1>
<h2 id="use-case"><a class="header" href="#use-case">Use-case</a></h2>
<p>Some types should not be held across a &quot;yield&quot; bound. A typical example is a <code>MutexGuard</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">async fn example(x: &amp;Lock&lt;u32&gt;) {
    let data = x.lock().unwrap();
    something().await;
    *data += 1;
}

async fn something() { }
</code></pre>
<p>In practice, a lot of these issues are avoided because <code>MutexGuard</code> is not <code>Send</code>, but single-thread runtimes hit these issues.</p>
<h2 id="types-where-this-would-apply"><a class="header" href="#types-where-this-would-apply">Types where this would apply</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>MutexGuard</code> for mutexes, read-write locks</li>

<li>Things that might use these types internally and wish to bubble it up</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="precedent-and-related-questions"><a class="header" href="#precedent-and-related-questions">Precedent and related questions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>#[must_use]</code> lint on types, we would want their design to work very closely.</li>

<ul>
<li>Currently the combinations are stored in the <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3/futures/stream/trait.StreamExt.html"><code>StreamExt</code></a> module.</li>
<li>In some cases, this is because of the lack of async closures support.
<ul>
<li>Also serves as a &quot;semver barrier&quot;.</li>
<li>Also no-std compatibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One question: what combinators (if any) to include when stabilizing?
<ul>
<li>e.g., <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3/futures/stream/trait.StreamExt.html#method.poll_next_unpin"><code>poll_next_unpin</code></a> can make working with pin easier, albeit at a loss of generality

<h1 id="--generator-syntax"><a class="header" href="#--generator-syntax">‚ö°  Generator syntax</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>It would be useful to be able to write a function to return an iterator or (in the async context) a generator</li>

<li>Just target iterators and streams, or shoot for something more general?</li>

<li>Some of the question marks that arise if you go beyond iterators and streams:
<ul>
<li>Return values that are not unit</li>
<li>Have yield return a value that is passed by the caller of <code>next</code> (&quot;resume args&quot;)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Async has worked well so far.  My top wishlist items are Sink and Stream traits in std.  It's quite difficult to abstract over types that asynchronously produce or consume values.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;AsyncRead/AsyncWrite work fine for files, tcp streams, etc.  But once you are past I/O and want to pass around structs, Sink and Stream are needed.  One example of fragmentation is that Tokio channels used to implement the futures Sink/Stream traits, but no longer do in 1.0.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I usually use Sink/Stream to abstract over different async channel types.  Sometimes to hide the details of external dependencies from a task (e.g. where is this data going?).  And sometimes to write common utility methods.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;One thing I can think of: there are still a lot of popular libraries that don't have async support (or are just getting there).  Rocket, Criterion, Crossterm's execute, etc.&quot;</li>

<li>&quot;I've written a bit of rust before, but rust is my first introduction to Async. My main gripes are that it's hard to figure our what the &quot;blessed&quot; way of doing async is. I'd love to see async included in the book, but I understand that async is still evolving too much for that.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Adding to the confusion: theres multiple executors, and they have a bit of lock in. Async libraries being dependent on which executor version I use is also confusing for newcomers. In other langs, it seems like one just uses everything from the stdlib and everything is compatible&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;That kind of gave me a lot of hesitation/fomo in the beginning, because it felt like I had to make some big choices around my tech stack that I felt I would be stuck with later. I ended up chatting about this in the discord &amp; researching for multiple days before getting started.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Also, due to there not being a &quot;blessed&quot; approach, I don't know if I'm working with some misconceptions around async in rust, and will end up discovering I will need to redo large parts of what I wrote.&quot;</li>
